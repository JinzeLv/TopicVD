Hiya, Frank. How are the wife and kids?
You know, for you, I'm considering treasury bonds and utility stocks. Smoke?
In the late '70s, banking wasn't a job you went into to make large sums of money.
It was a fucking snooze.
How about those Mets?
Filled with losers. Like selling insurance or accounting.
And if banking was boring, then the bond department at the bank was straight-up comatose.
We all know about bonds.
You give them to your snot-nosed kid when he turns 15.
Maybe when he's 30 he makes a hundred bucks.
Boring.
That is, until Lewis Ranieri came on the scene at Salomon Brothers.
You might not know who he is, but he changed your life more than Michael Jordan, the iPod and YouTube put together.
All right, gentlemen! Let's get some money in here!
Let's make some money! What do you say?
You see, Lewis didn't know it yet, but he had already changed banking forever with one simple idea.
The mortgage-backed security.
Or private-label MBS.
You've got your average person's mortgage.
Fixed rate, 30 years.
Boring, safe, small payoff, right? But, when you have thousands of them all bundled together, suddenly the yield goes up but the risk is still small because, well, they're mortgages!
And who the hell doesn't pay their mortgage?
What exactly is the credit rating on this bond?
This bond, gentlemen, is AAA-rated.
This is exactly what the Michigan state pension fund has been looking for.
I'll buy $20 million.
Oh, come on, live a little.
$25 million.
The money came raining down, and for the first time, the banker went from the country club to the strip club.
Pretty soon, stocks and savings were almost inconsequential.
They were doing $50, $100, $200 billion in mortgage bonds and dozens of other securities a year.
And America barely noticed as its number one industry became boring old banking.
And then one day, almost 30 years later, in 2008, it all came crashing down.
March. Bear Stearns was in a death spiral and the Fed brokered its sale.
It's been called the worst financial crisis in modern times.
Certainly the largest financial disaster in decades in this country, and perhaps the end of an era in American business.
In the end, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage-backed security mutated into a monstrosity that collapsed the whole world economy.
And none of the experts or leaders or talking heads had a clue it was coming.
I'm guessing most of you still don't really know what happened.
Yeah, you got a soundbite you repeat so you don't sound dumb, but come on.
Our financial institutions are strong.
But there were some who saw it coming.
While the whole world was having a big old party, a few outsiders and weirdos saw what no one else could.
Not me. I'm not a weirdo. I'm pretty fucking cool.
But we'll meet again later.
These outsiders saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy.
And they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do.
They looked.
During the 1930s, the housing market collapsed nationwide by roughly 80%.
I mean, half of all mortgage debt was in default.
And, I mean, there were very specific identifiers, extremely recognizable.
I mean, for instance, one of the hallmarks of mania is the rapid rise in complexity and the rates of fraud.
And did you know that they're going up?
I've always been more comfortable alone.
I believe maybe it's because of my glass eye.
I lost the eye in a childhood illness.
It separates me from people.
And did you know that they are going up?
The highest fraud rates since the 1930s.
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's okay.
No, I didn't know that.
In 1933, the fourth year of the Great Depression.
Let's wash it off and put it back in.
You were playing so great, son.
I even heard the coach say it.
Can we just go home?
Most social interactions are awkward for me and for the person.
Even when I try to compliment someone, it comes out wrong.
You have a very nice haircut. Did you do it yourself?
What?
No. No, I I'm sorry. I'm just I'm going on and on.
My wife told me I need to share more.
- That seems healthy. - Yeah.
So do I get the job?
I really think I could help your fund.
Yeah.
Yeah, sure. Go on.
- You're... - David. Great.
I guess I'll go find a desk.
Is there anything you want me to work on for start Yeah.
You could let me know later. I could come back.
Did you think it was strange when, the tech bubble burst in 2001 and the housing market in San Jose, the tech capital of the world, went up?
Wasn't that strange?
No.
No, it's housing. Housing is always stable.
Low risk. It's solid.
That's the idea, yeah.
I want you to get me the top 20 selling mortgage bonds.
So you want to know what the top 20 selling mortgage bonds are?
No, no, no, I want to know what mortgages are in each one.
Okay, aren't those mortgages made up of... Wait, aren't those bonds made up of thousands and thousands of mortgages?
Yeah.
Right away, Dr. Burry.
I am a nice guy all day long.
Ask anyone, I'm a pleasure to work with.
But the second my son screws up, I am yelling at him just like my dad did to me.
I hear the words that are coming out of my mouth and Sorry I'm late! No cabs.
So, get this.
I met with this retail banker yesterday.
I'm supposed to be getting him to invest in a fund, but instead I start grilling him about overdraft penalties and how his bank will let a customer write 10-12 checks before they tell them they're overdrawn.
And this creep is making billions off screwing over people this way.
And I'm getting madder and madder.
And I ask him, I look him in the face and I say, "How can you sleep at night knowing that you are ripping off working people"?
And you know what he did? He left.
He just walks out of the lunch, doesn't say a word.
What the fuck is that?
Who's fucked up in that scenario? Am I?
Or is this douchebag, who leaves me hanging?
Is he the fucked up one?
We have talked about this numerous times.
You can't come in late and hijack the entire session.
What do you mean? I didn't hijack the meeting.
Did I hijack the session?
Yeah.
What do you do?
I'm in commodities.
Good luck with that.
Mark, I know you suffered a terrible loss.
Maybe you want to talk about that.
I don't talk about that.
Hold on.
Hold on Shit, I have to take this. Sorry. Sorry.
No I don't care, Porter.
This guy's whole business is built on ripping people off.
How long can that last?
Bye, everybody!
95 That's 30 days late... Sixty days late They pay on time... These FICO scores.
Late. And they caught up on their payments... Another 30 days late... LTV, 95 LTV, 90 They caught up on their payments... Sixty days late? Jesus!
LTV, 110? I've never heard of that!
Thirty days late, rate adjusts In '07 rate adjusts, In '06 rate adjusts, 95 90 Jesus!
He hasn't moved all day.
He does this every few days.
He hasn't spoken to me since he hired me.
Maybe the LTV's at... High-risk, interest-only I never heard of that mortgage history, I never heard of that How?
Michael, how are you, guy?
Lawrence, I found something really interesting.
Great, Michael. Whenever you find something interesting, we all tend to make money.
What stock are you valuing?
No, no, no, no. No stocks.
I want to short the housing market.
Really? But the housing market is rock solid.
Greenspan just said bubbles are regional, defaults are rare.
Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
- Say again? - Look, look Greenspan's wrong.
I don't think you mean to do this, but sometimes you sound very dismissive and superior.
It's a fact. Greenspan's wrong.
I don't know how else you want me to say Look, Michael.
Metro Capital backed you four years ago when you were a doctor with a dinky webpage and some inheritance money.
We've all done very well.
Why don't you just stick with stocks?
Look. You know me. I, I, I... I look for value wherever it can be found.
And the fact is that these mortgage-backed securities are filled with extremely risky subprime adjustable-rate loans.
And when the majority of the adjustable rates kick in, in '07, they will begin to fail.
And if they fail above 15%, the whole bond is worthless.
Michael, just take a beat.
We'll talk about this later, okay?
Lawrence, please, don't patronize me. Listen Mortgage-backed securities.
It, it, it Subprime loans. Tranches.
It's pretty confusing, right?
Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid?
Well, it's supposed to.
Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do.
Or, even better, for you to just leave them the fuck alone.
So here's Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain.
Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds were amazingly profitable for the big banks.
They made billions and billions on their 2% fee they got for selling each of these bonds.
But then they started running out of mortgages to put in them.
After all, there are only so many homes and so many people with good enough jobs to buy them, right?
So the banks started filling these bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages.
Thank you, Benter.
That way they can keep that profit machine churning, right?
By the way, these risky mortgages are called subprime.
So whenever you hear "Subprime", think "Shit".
Our friend Michael Burry found out that these mortgage bonds that were supposedly 65% AAA were actually just mostly full of shit.
So now he's going to "Short" the bonds.
Which means to "Bet against".
Got it?
Good.
Now fuck off.
It's only a matter of time before someone else sees this investment.
We have to act now!
How do you know the bonds are worthless?
Aren't they filled with fucking thousands of pages of mortgages?
I read them.
- You read them? - I read Yes.
No one reads them. Only the lawyers who put them together read them.
Look, I don't think that they even know what they've made.
The housing market is propped up on these bad loans, and I'm It's a time bomb, and I want to short it.
Through what instrument, Michael?
There are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds.
The bonds are too stable.
Lawrence This is what I'm gonna do. I am gonna get a bank to make me one.
And then I'm gonna buy it.
I don't want that kind of business.
Money is not money. That's bad money.
Hey! Excuse me!
Let me ask you this. What company treats its customers that shittily and succeeds?
Fine. Okay, Goldman. You're right.
Mark Baum had built his career on never assuming anyone or any company was legit without proving it.
When he was a kid he excelled at studying the Talmud in Yeshiva. Whatever.
But one day his rabbi told his mom why.
Paul is a fine boy, and Mark is an excellent student of the Torah and the Talmud.
Then what's the problem, rabbi?
It's the reason Mark is studying so hard.
He's looking for inconsistencies in the word of God!
So has he found any?
Later, Baum started his own fund on Wall Street.
He had an amazing nose for bullshit.
And he wasn't afraid to let anyone know when and where the bull had gone number two.
But then a tragedy happened to Mark, and it turned his world view dark and ready to believe the whole system was a lie.
Hold on.
It's Cynthia.
I'll be in the office in 20 minutes.
Hi, honey.
The therapist called. You did it again.
There were no cabs. What was I supposed to do?
I worry about you, Mark.
At least I went.
You're running around like you have to right
- every wrong in the world. - Okay.
You're so angry.
Fine. You know what?
I'm a mean guy and I'm pissed off.
But it is a shit storm out here, sweetie.
You have no idea the kind of crap people are pulling.
And everyone's walking around like they're in a goddamn Enya video.
They're all getting screwed, you know.
You know what they care about?
They care about the ballgame.
Or they care about what actress just went into rehab.
I think you should try medication.
No, no. We agreed.
If it interfered with work.
You hate Wall Street. Maybe it's time to quit.
- I love my job. - You hate your job.
I love my job.
You're miserable.
I love my job.
I love my job, honey.
Mark I am sad every day about what happened.
I know you must feel the same, but you never show it.
I know how close you were to your brother.
Paul.
Where'd you go, Paul?
Paul!
Every day I think you're gonna talk about it, but you never do.
Will you at least think about the idea of making a change?
Fine. Fine. Honey, you know what? I will consider it.
But, honestly, Cynthia.
I'm okay. I really am.
No, no.
My cab. That's my cab.
That's my cab. That is my cab.
- Schmuck. Fuck you. - Fuck you.
- Fuck you. - Fuck you.
I'll call you later.
I want to buy swaps on mortgage bonds.
A credit default swap that will pay off if the underlying bond fails.
You want to bet against the housing market?
- Yes. - Why?
Those bonds only fail if millions of Americans don't pay their mortgages.
That's never happened in history.
If you'll excuse me, Dr. Burry, it seems like a foolish investment.
Well, based on prevailing sentiment of the market and banks in popular culture, yes, it's a foolish investment.
But,everyone's wrong.
That's a good one.
This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry.
If you offer us free money, we are going to take it.
My one concern is that when the bonds fail, I want to be certain, um, of payment in case of solvency issues with your bank.
I'm sorry, are you for real?
You wanna bet against the housing market and you're worried we won't pay you?
Yes, that's correct.
... unless the market crashes.
The market on housing's never gonna crash because it's so solid right now.
I mean, who doesn't pay their mortgages?
Dr. Burry, we could work out a pay-as-we-go structure that would pay out if the bonds fail.
But it would also apply to your payments if the value of the mortgage bond goes up.
You'd have to pay us monthly premiums.
Is that acceptable, Dr. Burry?
Yes. Yes.
I have prospectuses on six mortgage-backed securities I want to short.
Majority of the mortgages... I don't see us losing any money on these at all.
Dr. Burry, these should be fine.
Yeah. We're prepared to sell you $5 million in credit default swaps on these mortgage bonds.
Can we make it $100 million?
Uh, absolutely, we can make it $100 million.
We'll be in touch, send some paperwork over.
I like these cups.
Can I take one for my son?
Have Yes. Yes.
Thank you.
Have two.
Is there any way to do $200 million?
I mean, we can. But are you sure?
Absolutely. Absolutely, we can do that.
We do different projects. We do gardening.
The bonds I'd like to bet against.
It's not bad seeing yourself on the big screen.
It's very cool.
I ordered the 24-ounce T-bone, which was choice.
- I went for volume - Yeah.
rather than prime.
I went for subprime, and the gist was Hey, Randall! What's with the Dom?
Bonuses aren't for three months.
We just sold $200 million in credit swaps for mortgage bonds.
Some fund manager from California.
It's fucking crazy, right?
A whole new way to make money, Doug.
Wait, wait. I didn't know there were swaps on mortgages.
There are now. We made it for him.
He must have gone off his Zoloft or something.
I don't know.
- Want to join? No? - Just a second.
Hey, Jared.
Did you hear about the deal that Randall just did with some fund manager?
Randall? Bullshit.
He's a foot soldier. I'm sure it's a shit deal.
No, it's for real.
I told you we'd meet later.
Unfortunately, it's in a place like this which I would never be.
I never hung out with these idiots after work, ever.
I had fashion friends.
Apparently, this guy wanted $200 mil in credit default swaps.
Randall made the sale.
Can you believe it?
Somebody shorted $200 mil on mortgage bonds?
That was just with Deutsche.
Word is he hit half the town.
How much in total?
$1.3 billion.
What?
That's pretty much all of Scion's liquidity.
Michael, this is highly distressing.
Lawrence, that is not all of our liquidity.
And I'm not certain that you really understand this trade.
This is a certainty.
Mike, I consider myself a mentor to you.
But our company is not comfortable with this investment. Am I being clear?
Lawrence, I have full autonomy when it comes to investment strategy.
You can read our agreement.
Do not throw our inception agreement in my face, Michael.
We had an underlying understanding you wouldn't act like a goddamn crazy man.
This is not crazy.
It's all very logical.
So, now we pay up premiums on these swaps against the housing market until the mortgages fail?
In other words, we lose millions until something that's never happened before happens?
That's correct.
Hello, Mark Baum.
Oh, hey, Kathy, you busted me.
I had a personal thing this afternoon.
I'm not your babysitter.
If FrontPoint makes money for Morgan Stanley, I'm happy.
Okay. Hey, did I hear you're expecting?
We're expecting to be expecting.
IVF's are cleaning us out but we're staying positive.
That's exciting!
Lump on my ball. And I go in for a scan.
Turns out that I have a very large thing called an epididymis.
Which is a thing that goes around the ball and is like a sac underneath.
I have an extremely
- pronounced epididymis. - I'm riveted I'm riveted by this. Do you have any pictures?
It's almost as large as another testicle unto itself.
So get this. Cynthia Guys. Cynthia wants me to quit and open a B&B in Vermont.
That sounds great. I'd love to see Mark Baum run a bed and breakfast.
Like, "Here's your steel-cut oatmeal, asshole."
Mark refused to kiss the ring of the people with the checkbooks, so he had to set up his fund under Morgan Stanley's umbrella.
His small team reflected his distrust of the system.
You guys are sick. You're sick.
She says this job is making me unhappy.
But you're happy when you're unhappy.
I am happy when I'm unhappy.
Vinnie Daniel.
You know how to make a muffin?
Mark's numbers guy.
Do you even know how
- to do laundry? Make a bed? - Okay Vinnie lost his father to a violent crime when he was young.
Just like Mark, he didn't talk about it.
I don't talk about that.
Cynthia's no joke.
She could actually make him move to Vermont.
I mean, she made me start wearing a seatbelt.
- Hey, you want me to - Porter Collins.
Former Olympic rower who went to Brown.
He worked with Baum at a previous firm and couldn't figure out why no one listened to Baum.
The guy with all the good ideas.
Sorry. I think you have the wrong FrontPoint.
Because there is another FrontPoint in this same building that is bonds.
And Danny Moses.
The optimist of the bunch.
And a hell of a trader.
Which is the only reason they put up with his bullshit optimism.
That was a weird call.
You take longer with a wrong number than anybody else.
It was this guy from Deutsche who was talking about shorting housing bonds.
And then in the middle of the call I realized he had the wrong FrontPoint.
And then because he wanted the one on the 8th floor.
He wanted to short housing bonds?
That happens like five times a day that somebody gets the wrong FrontPoint.
- We should change our name. - Wait. Wait.
He wanted to short housing bonds?
Who bets against housing?
What's the ABX at?
What's ABX?
It tracks subprime mortgage bond value.
Go back to sleep.
The ABX is at, it's down! It's down three points since last year.
That's weird. I haven't heard a peep about that.
What was this guy's name?
Jared Vennett. Vennett.
That's right. These lucky sons of bitches caught wind of one of the best trades in Wall Street history from a wrong number.
They should have paid 10% to my fuckstick assistant.
His name was Jared Vennett. Vennett.
Jared Vennett from Deutsche.
Sounded very sketchy.
Sounds like a douchebag.
Do you smell that?
Do you smell that?
I smell money.
This is your basic mortgage.
Okay, hi. How are you?
Have a seat.
Okay, Mr. Vennett from Deutsche Bank.
What do we have?
There you go.
So, how many people have you talked to about this trade?
A few. There's definitely some interest.
- No! - My boss would have my ass...
- N.O.! - You crazy, Jared?
- Get lost. - Fuck you.
Which is why you're here talking to us, a wrong number.
Sounds like there's a lot of interest.
All right. A few people have invited us in just to laugh at me on this deal. Is that you?
Is that what this is?
That's not what this is.
That's just how Mark is.
- Let's see what you got. - I'm sorry.
You smell that? What is that?
- What? - What's that smell?
Your cologne?
No.
Opportunity.
No. Money.
Okay.
- I smell money. - Okay.
- Chris, God damn it. - Sorry.
This is your basic mortgage bond.
All right? The originals were simple.
They were just thousands of AAA mortgages bundled together, guaranteed by the U.S. Government.
The modern ones are different.
They're private. And they're made up of layers of tranches.
The highest level, AAA, is getting paid first.
The lowest rated, B, is getting paid last, taking on defaults first.
Now, obviously, if you're buying B's, you could make more money.
But they're a little risky.
Sometimes they fail.
Chris?
Somewhere along the line, these B's and BB's went from a little risky to dog shit. Where's the trash?
It's right behind you.
I'm talking rock-bottom FICO scores.
No income verification.
Adjustable rates. Dog shit!
The default rates are already up from 1% to 4%, fellas.
And if they rise to 8%, and they will, a lot of these BBB's are going to zero, too.
And You're too close.
It is an opportunity.
Okay.
You're saying that at 8% the bonds fail and we are already at 4%?
That's right.
If they go to 8%, it's Armageddon?
Yeah. That's right.
How come nobody's talking about this?
You're completely sure of the math?
Look at him. That's my quant.
Your what?
My quantitative!
My math specialist. Look at him.
You notice anything different about him? Look at his face.
That's pretty racist.
Look at his eyes! I'll give you a hint.
His name's Yang!
He won a national math competition in China!
He doesn't even speak English!
I'm sure of the math.
Actually, my name's Jiang and I do speak English.
Jared likes to say I don't because he thinks it makes me seem more authentic.
And I got second in that national math competition.
So you're offering us a chance to short this pile of blocks? How?
With something called a credit default swap.
It's like insurance on the bond, and if it goes bust you can make 10-to-1, even 20-to-1 return.
And it's already slowly going bust!
10-to-1? 20-to-1? No way.
And no one's paying attention.
No one is paying attention!
Because the banks are too busy getting paid obscene fees to sell these bonds.
But wait. You are the bank. You work for the bank.
I bet your margins are pretty nice and fat.
Let's not talk about my margins, by the way.
Being nice and fat, that's a nice shirt. Do they make it for men?
Aren't you the bank?
I work for the bank. I don't think like a bank.
Big bank, small bank, I like to make money. All right?
Let me put it this way.
I'm standing in front of a burning house and I'm offering you fire insurance on it.
How can these underlying bonds be as bad as you say?
It wouldn't be legal.
Nobody knows what's in them.
Nobody knows what's in the bonds.
I've seen some that are 65% AAA-rated that I know for a fact are filled with 95% subprime shit with FICOs below 550!
Get the fuck out of here.
You want me to really blow your mind?
When the market deems a bond too risky to buy, what do you think we do with it?
Take a guess.
I don't know. You tell me.
All right. You think we just warehouse it on the books? No.
We just repackage it with a bunch of other shit that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.
- A CDO? - Yes. A CDO.
What is that?
This is where we take a bunch of B's, BB's and BBB's that haven't sold, and we put them in a pile.
And when the pile gets large enough, the whole thing is suddenly considered diversified and the whores at the rating agency give it a 92%-93% AAA rating, no questions asked.
Hold it. What? Say that again.
A collateralized debt obligation.
It's important to understand because it's what allowed a housing crisis to become a nationwide economic disaster.
Here's world-famous chef Anthony Bourdain to explain.
Okay, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon setting the menu at a big restaurant.
I ordered my fish on Friday, which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted.
But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell.
I don't know why. Maybe it just came out halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin.
So, what am I going to do?
Throw all this unsold fish, which is the BBB level of the bond, in the garbage and take the loss?
No way.
Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am, whatever crappy levels of the bond I don't sell, I throw into a seafood stew.
See, it's not old fish. It's a whole new thing!
And the best part is they're eating 3-day-old halibut.
That is a CDO.
I just need to know, how could these possibly be collated?
Somehow you're like Dora the Explorer and you're the first person who found this thing.
Hold on. Hold on.
So mortgage bonds are dog shit, CDOs are dog shit wrapped in cat shit.
Yeah, that's right.
Institutions treat these CDOs like they're as solid as treasury bonds, and they're going to zero.
No. That can't be right. There were $500 billion in housing bonds sold last year alone.
The rating agencies, the banks, the fucking government, you're saying they're all asleep at the wheel?
Yeah. My whole department's long on this stuff.
They call me Chicken Little. They call me Bubble Boy.
A's, zero. B's, zero.
BB's, zero. BBB's, zero.
And then that happens.
What is that?
That's America's housing market.
Thank you.
Fuckin' A, Jared.
Shut your fucking mouth.
- hang out with you. - Good. Okay.
Sack up, do the deal. Let's be friends.
We will see. Thank you.
- Don't bullshit me. - All right.
You're gonna say no, aren't you?
No. No, I'm just evaluating right now.
Thank you. Thank you for coming in.
Bye, Jared.
I don't like it.
He's playing us.
He's playing us. He's got too much skin in the game and he's dumping his position.
What if he's right?
You want him to be right.
Yes, I do.
The banks have given us 25% interest rates on credit cards.
They have screwed us on student loans that we can never get out from under.
Then this guy walks into my office and says those same banks got greedy, they lost track of the market, and I can profit off of their stupidity?
Fuck, yeah, I want him to be right!
How come you don't hate this guy?
He's everything you taught us not to trust.
I can't hate him. He is so transparent in his self-interest that I kind of respect him.
Would I buy a car from him? No.
Is he right about the mortgage market?
- No. - Let's find out. Let's find out.
Look. It's two very simple questions.
Is there a housing bubble?
And if there is, how exposed are the banks?
Yeah. Okay.
Let's get on this quickly too.
Because if he's right, every loser with a couple million bucks and a fund is gonna be jumping on this.
Let's go.
Just that morning JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase.
Okay. Stop saying "JPMorgan Chase".
I got a good feeling about this.
It's just a meeting though, you know?
It's just a meeting. It's something like people have meetings all the time. You know?
People drink their coffee, they have a meeting.
- Brownfield Fund? - Yes!
- Hey. Hello. - Ted.
Chris. I'm on Ted's desk.
Chris. Okay.
- I'm Charlie, Charlie Geller. - Charlie.
- Jamie Shipley. Hi. - Jamie.
We're so excited to get set up on your trading platform.
Cool.
Here, have a seat a second.
All right.
So,Ted had asked me to do some meeting prep.
But I couldn't find any marketing material on you guys.
We just moved here from Boulder.
- Yeah. - Got it.
Could we see some of your offering documents?
Well, Brownfield is its own money.
- It's our money. - Yeah.
Can you tell us how much you manage?
Of course. We're doing $30 million right now.
Um, but we started four years ago with $110,000.
So, as you can see, that's pretty phenomenal returns.
We want to get an ISDA agreement with JPMorgan so we can deal in long-term options.
- That's really cool. - Yeah.
That is so cool.
Thank you.
But you guys are under the capital requirements for an ISDA.
By how much?
One billion four hundred seventy million, so a lot.
This makes us look bad, doesn't it, that we didn't know what the capital requirements were?
It's not great.
But, uh, keep up those returns and give us a call way down the line. You know.
Okay?
- Okay. - Thanks, Chris.
Have a good one, guys.
Thank you, Chris.
Shit!
Who the fuck schedules a meeting
- 4:50 in the afternoon? - Oh, my, God.
That was so painful.
Dude, B of A and Bear didn't even return our calls.
And even fucking Wachovia blew us off, man!
I know.
Here's the prospectuses of all the other losers who didn't make it past the lobby.
I don't think I can do this anymore. You know.
I'm young, yet. I can still do something with my life.
I miss Colorado anyway. The weed's better.
Gentlemen, I need you to leave.
Yep,we're going. Let's go.
Look at this. Look at this.
This guy says that the housing market's a giant bubble.
Okay, so this part isn't totally accurate, you know.
We didn't find Jared Vennett's housing bubble pitch in the lobby of a bank that rejected us.
The truth is, a friend had told Charlie about it, and I read about it in Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
This is crazy.
This is crazy stuff.
Shit, he's saying that there's 10-to-1 returns on credit default swaps for mortgage-backed securities?
And the whole housing market is about to collapse?
For Jamie and Charlie, the housing market doomsday prediction was music to their ears.
I'm so happy, coz today I found my friend, they're in my head.
They had started working out of Jamie's garage with $110,000 Jamie had saved taking sailboats up and down the East Coast.
Our investment strategy was simple.
People hate to think about bad things happening, so they always underestimate their likelihood.
Their strategy was simple and brilliant.
What he said.
Jamie and Charlie found markets will sell options very cheaply on things they think will never happen.
So when they were wrong, they were wrong small, but when they were right, they were right big.
Within a few years they had turned $110,000 into $30 million.
But then it was time to go to New York City.
And so far, it wasn't going very well.
So what if it does seem interesting.
No bank will give us our ISDA.
We're dead in the water.
These kind of trades are totally out of the question.
We got to call Ben.
Let's call Ben!
Ben Rickert was a former trader in Singapore for Chase who quit the whole game in disgust.
He happened to be Jamie's neighbor when they were in Colorado and they met walking dogs.
But Ben was dark.
He didn't just think the whole system would fail.
He thought the whole world was going down.
Every one of these vegetables is fresh from my garden.
You guys should start your own garden.
What you got to do is get your soil off the petrochemicals.
I used wood ash and urine to help restore the soil.
It creates ammonium nitrate.
Seeds are gonna be the new currency.
And not those Franken-seeds from Monsanto.
I'm talking about good, healthy, organic seeds.
Make yourself a garden.
- Learn to live off the land. - You're a fucking lunatic.
Ben had real experience in a big bank.
Jamie and Charlie had never even been in a Manhattan bank bathroom.
But Ben was done with the banking world.
He was very clear.
All right, let's crunch some numbers and then maybe we'll talk about calling Ben.
We're always crunching numbers.
When haven't we crunched the numbers?
We're gonna crunch the numbers like harder I need you out of here.
Of course. One second.
Yes,We're going.
Oh, God. I hate this. This is a total waste of time.
Oh, come on. Would you relax?
There's a housing development 45 minutes outside town.
Mark wants us to check that out first.
Well, I hope there are some Cuban restaurants on the way there.
Because I heard the Cuban food is amazing in Miami.
Please don't be chipper in the face of me being miserable.
It really makes me hate you.
How is wanting to eat good food being chipper?
Hello?
Hello?
What do these go for?
$425,000 each?
What's up, man? What do you want?
Hello. I'm surveying mortgage owners who are over 90 days delinquent.
I'm looking for a Harvey Humpsey.
You want my landlord's dog?
Your landlord filled out his mortgage application using his dog's name?
I guess so.
Wait, has that asshole not been paying his mortgage?
Because I've been paying my rent.
Well, yeah, he is over 90 days delinquent.
Seriously, man, am I gonna have to leave?
Because my kid just got settled in school, man.
Hey. How are you?
My name's Ken.
You're Ken?
Um, you should talk to your landlord about that.
I'm sorry, I don't have any more information.
But you, um... You have a great day. See ya, Ken.
There's books everywhere!
Books everywhere?
Seriously, man, is everything gonna be okay?
You should call him.
You should give him a call.
It's not my fault, dude. I've been paying... Hello!
Looks somebody just left.
Look. All they took was the TV.
It's weird.
They didn't even clean out the counter.
Oh, God.
It's like Chernobyl.
There's like a hundred houses.
There can't be four people living here.
- Oh, fuck that! - Shit!
He's been in there for seven hours.
Where does he go to the bathroom?
I heard he had a breakdown.
He's letting the fund tank.
My buddy in Manhattan said... Dr. Burry's office.
No, he actually prefers that you email him.
Excuse me.
Mr. Fields, Mr...
- Hi, Lawrence. - Holy shit!
We have no confidence in your ability to identify macroeconomic trends.
You flew here to tell me that? Why?
Anyone can see that there is a real estate bubble.
Actually, no one can see a bubble.
That's what makes it a bubble.
That's dumb, Lawrence.
There's always markers.
Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring.
That means the homes are debt, not assets.
So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.
Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
That's cute. That's cute.
Are you being sarcastic with us, Mike?
Lawrence, I don't know how to be sarcastic.
I don't know how to be funny. I don't know how to work people.
I... I just know how to read numbers.
How big is your short position right now?
Just $1.3 billion.
And the premiums?
Well, we pay, uh, roughly $80 to 90 million each year, which is high, but I was the first to do this trade.
Watch. It will pay.
I may have been early, but I'm not wrong.
It's the same thing. It's the same thing, Mike!
You're managing a fund of, what, $555 million?
In six years, it'll all be gone.
On one bet.
No, the second quarter of '07 is when the adjustable rates kick in.
The defaults will skyrocket.
Yeah. Says you.
How much is eligible for withdrawal before they do?
Say, in the next two quarters.
If your investors panic.
$302 million?
I... My God, Mike.
No one will pull out. That would be suicide.
I mean, I'm down 17% for the year.
But if they trust me, and they trust me, because No one trusts you! No one!
I sent several emails to my investors letting them know that the second quarter of '07 is when our housing positions show returns and I've been very clear.
People will withdraw their money.
Lawrence, that would be so stupid. I mean, If the fund's capitals drop too much, then the swaps contracts are voided.
And then the banks get to keep all of the collateral.
- Wait a minute. Wait. - All of it.
The contracts are voided?
The contracts are voided?
Holy shit!
Oh, motherfucker!
Michael?
Give me my money back.
Michael, do you hear me? I want my money back.
Give me my fucking money back you motherfucker.
The market's in an itsy-bitsy little gully right now.
It's like everybody said, "Okay, that was crazy".
"Let's just all calm down".
I sold that house for $350,000 the year it was built.
Two years later, $480,000.
Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.
This couple bought it for $650,000 last year.
He'd let it go for that.
Hi, John.
No, no, no.
It will break his heart, but he'll let it go.
Why is he selling?
Neither one's working right now.
Marlene, you'd say they're motivated, right?
As motivated as one can be in this neighborhood.
This house on the left, I would say they're probably motivated.
Wow, a lot of people seem very motivated.
Oh, it's just the gully.
That's all.
Just nerves.
So where do we stand?
I need to talk to my wife. Um... This market won't last.
Actually, could I talk to a mortgage broker?
Anybody you recommend? Anybody you like.
Yes, yes, I have someone. Absolutely.
Yeah, bitch better like me.
Sent her ass to Cabo.
So is Morgan Stanley recruiting us? Is that it?
Oh, no. No. The bank owns our hedge fund, but we're not really part of it.
We invest in financial service companies and we're trying to understand the residential mortgage business.
How many loans do you write each month?
- About 60. - Yeah.
What was it four years ago?
Ten Maybe 15.
Yeah, I was a bartender. Now I own a boat.
You own a... So how many of these are adjustable-rate mortgages?
- Well, most. - Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'd say about 90%.
The bonuses on those skyrocketed a few years ago.
Adjustable's our bread and honey.
So do applicants ever get rejected?
Seriously?
Look, if they get rejected, I suck at my job.
Even if they have no money?
Well, my firm offers NINJA loans.
"No Income, No Job".
I just leave the income section blank if I want.
Corporate doesn't care.
These people just want homes. And they go with the flow.
Good for you.
Your companies don't verify?
If I write a loan on Friday afternoon, a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch.
Yeah. Same here.
Could you hold on a second?
Yeah.
I don't get it. Why are they confessing?
They're not confessing.
They're bragging.
Do people have any idea what they are buying?
I focus on the immigrants, you know.
Once they find out they're getting a home, they sign where you tell them to sign.
Don't ask questions. Don't understand the rates.
- Fucking idiots. - Yeah.
And you target immigrants, too?
Well, their credit actually isn't bad enough for him.
Look, I'm a yield guy.
Okay... I make $2,000 on a fixed-rate prime loan, right?
But I can make $10,000 on a subprime adjustable.
Trust me, I'm not driving a 7 Series without strippers.
No one on the pole has good credit and they're all cash rich.
I think I read Warren Buffett say something like that.
What? Who's Warren Buffett?
Okay, so strippers. Like exotic dancers?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nude, you know, topless.
- Strippers. - Yeah.
Can you introduce us?
Yes! Yes.
I always get option-pay adjustables.
I'm a private contractor.
What? I can't hear you. I'm sorry.
I always get option-pay adjustables.
I'm a private contractor. I need flexibility.
And you tell the mortgage company what you do?
I write "Therapist".
- You can touch me. - Always?
Only in V.I.P.
No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables.
And you have more than one loan on a property?
Everybody does. At least down here.
I'm sorry, what?
Everybody does. At least down here.
That way you only put down, like, 5%.
Prices have leveled off, though, right?
Yeah. There's a gully.
Would you mind not moving anymore? I'll still pay you.
Sorry. We're not alone.
Okay, look. If home prices don't go up, you are not going to be able to refinance.
And you'll be stuck paying whatever your monthly payment is once it jumps up after your teaser rate expires.
Your monthlies could go up 200%-300%.
James says I can always refinance.
Well, he's a liar.
Actually, in this particular case, James probably is wrong.
200 percent? On all my loans?
What do you mean "All" Your loans?
We're talking about two loans on one house, right?
I have five houses.
And a condo.
Hey, there's a bubble.
How do you know?
Trust me. Call Vennett, buy $50 million in swaps on the MBS.
What do we got? Garibaldi IV, BBB.
Mark, are you sure?
Yeah. Yeah, it's time to call bullshit.
- Bullshit on what? - Every fucking thing.
Is this America's angriest hedge fund?
All right, listen. I got one last question for you.
How are you fucking us?
There's a nicer way to say that, Vinnie.
I'm serious.
We'll buy your swaps, but only if you say how you're fucking us.
I'm not fucking you, Vinnie. I'm kissing you.
I'm looking deep into your eyes as I make love to you, Vinnie.
I'm handing you the deal of the century on a fucking platter.
What do I get out of it? Easy.
I got a $20-million-a-month negative carry.
I got bosses trying to pull the plug because they think I'm out of my fucking mind.
All right?
We make this trade, those problems aren't so big anymore.
And sure, swaps are a dark market, so I set the price.
Whatever price I want.
And when you come for the payday, I'm gonna rip your eyes out, I'm gonna make a fortune.
But the good news is, Vinnie, you're not gonna care because you're gonna make so much fucking money.
That's what I get out of it.
Want to know what you get out of it?
You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana, and the nuts.
Right now, I get the sprinkles, and, yeah, if this goes through, I get the cherry.
But you get the sundae, Vinnie.
You get the sundae.
All right, I buy that. Thank you.
So what do you say?
- You want me to make you a market? - Yeah.
We'll take $50 million, Garibaldi IV, BBB.
Sharpen your pencils. I'll get the paperwork ready.
Fuck you, too.
Yes!
That's right.
Oh, man.
He has so many numbers, and I always forget which one he prefers, because he's very specific.
Start with the first one.
I don't know if it's the first one.
Just try it.
Okay. I... Okay.
- Ben Rickert. - Hey, Ben. It's Jamie.
Jamie, you know you're not supposed to use this line.
Told you.
Okay, let's try number two out of 14.
Ben Rickert.
Ben, why do you do that, man? I mean You're a retired trader, okay? No one is listening to your calls.
The NSA has a $52 billion budget and the ability to monitor tens of millions of calls a second.
You think they're not using it?
Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying "Ben Rickert" And "Dirty bomb" in the same sent
- Jesus fucking Christ. - I'm sorry, dude.
Ben Rickert.
Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?
It's Charlie. I'm here, too.
Hi, Charlie. Yeah, I did. Hold on.
Ben, you still there?
Yeah.
I'll be honest, gentlemen.
It scared the shit out of me.
But that's a good thing, right?
That means this Vennett guy's not wrong.
No, he's not.
Cool.
Tell me more about these CDOs.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, so, you know, Vennett mentions the CDOs, but actually, we took a look and they're way worse than even he realizes.
These things don't make any sense!
We can't even model them.
These are 100 times bigger than the MBS.
And 90% AAA-rated.
- Yes! Exactly! - Over 90%.
It's incredible.
I took a good hard look at the CDOs you want to short.
They're brilliant. Worthless. Total crap.
Jamie. Very good.
What can I say? I'm good at finding shit.
So, Ben, we shorted the BB's and the BBB's, and the risk is relatively low.
- Payoff is, like, 25-to-1. - Yeah.
Okay, so, why are you calling me? I don't do this anymore.
Look, Ben?
We need you to help us get the ISDA.
If we get a hunting license, we can short this crap.
And we know you hate Wall Street.
We're not asking you to do the trading.
We're simply asking you to help us get a seat at the fucking table.
It's a pretty ugly table, guys.
Look, Ben, the system fucked up in a big, big way here, okay?
And somehow, uh, we know before anyone else.
You know? This is a once-in-a-lifetime deal.
I'm thinking.
Okay. I'll call Deutsche Bank.
Thank you, Ben. Thank you.
And Bear. What about Bear? They have some reprehensible product.
Okay. Bear will trade with anybody.
All right. I'll see if I can push it through.
Thank you, Noah. And thank Jared for us.
Couldn't we go inside?
Yeah, me, too.
Hi, this is Mark. I need to talk to Vinnie right now.
We're just asking you to explain to us just how it is that you are fucking us, because what we are seeing Morgan Stanley building, fast.
Are we hooked up to the same computer screen?
It doesn't make any sense.
Vinnie, you there?
Mark, you there?
Yeah, did you hear?
Mortgage defaults have gone through the roof.
Is anybody jumping off of buildings yet?
Why would they? Subprime mortgage bond prices are up.
What?
Vennett wants $1.9 million more in collateral by close.
Vennett's asking us to post collateral.
What the hell is going on?
We don't know, but Deutsche's on the phone demanding payment.
Call Vennett. Call that little shit.
Call Vennett. Tell him to get his ass down here.
So subprime loans go bad, but subprime bonds, which are made up of subprime loans, are more valuable?
I know. They want another $1.9 million by market close.
What about the ratings agencies? Moody's, S&P... Are they downgrading the CDOs and mortgage bonds?
Where are the ratings agencies at?
They're the fucking same.
No, they're all still AAA.
What the hell? Are you fucking kidding me?
Those fuckers! Those motherfuckers!
They go public, and all they care about is their bottom line and their shit.
Hey, Mark, that's not all.
The Morgan Stanley risk guys are here.
They called in Kathy Tao.
They're trying to convince her to make us sell our swaps.
Apparently, tying up six years of insurance payments in hopes of a housing Armageddon is not prudent investing.
What did Kathy say?
Nothing yet. She keeps asking if this is one of your crusades.
Okay, I want you to walk back in there and very calmly, very politely, tell the risk assessors to fuck off.
And then meet me over at Standard & Poor's.
We're gonna talk to Georgia.
All right. Okay.
Get that fuck Jared Vennett in this office.
I'm gonna bash his fucking head in.
Uh, gentlemen?
I spoke with Mark Baum. He says to fuck off.
I can't see a damn thing.
My eye doctor's always busy.
I end up taking any appointment they'll give me, and then the whole morning gets shot to hell!
So All righty, FrontPoint Partners, how can Standard & Poor's help you?
Well, we don't understand why the ratings agencies haven't downgraded subprime bonds since the underlying loans are clearly deteriorating.
Well, the delinquency rates do have people worried, but they're actually within our models.
- So... - Says you.
You're convinced the underlying mortgages in these bonds are solid loans.
That is our opinion, yes.
Have you looked at the loan-level data?
I mean, they're giving these loans to anybody with a credit score and a pulse.
Excuse me, sir. What do you think we do here all day?
We're not sure. That's why we're here.
Here's what I don't understand We check, recheck, recheck again.
If these mortgage bonds are so stable Perhaps you could check your friend.
have you ever refused to rate
- Ma'am, that's delusional. - We stand behind them.
Georgia, have you ever refused to rate any of these bonds upper tranches AAA?
Can we see the paperwork on those deals?
I am under no obligation to share that information with you, whoever you might be.
Just answer the question, Georgia.
Can you name one time in the past year where you checked the tape and you didn't give the banks the AAA percentage they wanted?
If we don't give them the ratings, they'll go to Moody's, right down the block.
If we don't work with them, they will go to our competitors.
Not our fault. Simply the way the world works.
- Holy shit. - Yes, now you see.
And I never said that.
They're selling ratings for fees.
A ratings shop.
You can afford to make less. Make less.
Nobody said that.
And it is not my decision. I have a boss.
Are you kidding me?
No, I am not "Kidding you".
How'd your boss do on the IPO?
Is that the angle you're taking?
- So, now, anyone who has a boss  - You’re obviously working for yourselves then.
can't be held responsible for doing shitty and illegal things.
What are you, four?
No, I am not four, Mr. Baum. I am not, no.
And I wonder what your incentives might be.
Is it maybe in your best interest to have the ratings change? Is it, perhaps?
How many credit default swaps do you own?
It doesn't make me wrong.
No.
It just makes you a hypocrite.
Fuck!
Mortgage delinquencies went up and the CDOs got more valuable. Unbelievable.
- Unbelievable. - We know. It's completely backwards.
I just called an old friend at Bear.
He didn't even know what a CDO is.
Yeah, I just had to wire Bear and Deutsche $70,000.
It's like two plus two equals fish.
It's rigged. We bought into a rigged game.
We're gonna lose everything.
I'm gonna have to move back in with my mom.
Can't do that.
All right. Well, I got a colonic appointment.
Wait a minute. Hold on, Ben.
Ben, look.
Either the banks are clueless and they don't know how to value these CDOs, or they're such crooks that the CDOs are worth shit and they're hiding it.
I think we should buy more swaps.
What?
Suck it up and pay up, fellas. We made a deal.
No way! No!
Are you fucking kidding me? You coming here to Are you serious? You think this is a game?
No. No. No. No. No.
Yeah. Yeah.
No! No! No!
No, seriously, a colonic once a year.
Ass!
And you got a matching little butler boy, you buttfuck!
- Are you done? - I think so, yeah.
God! I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling.
Mortgage defaults have done nothing but go up.
Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.
Please explain that to me. There's no way that makes sense.
There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.
Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?
Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless? Didn't I say that?
- Yes. - Didn't I say it?
Yes, you did. You did.
Shut up.
Now their foot's on fire, they think their steak is done, and you're surprised?
That's not stupidity. That's fraud.
Tell me the difference between stupid and illegal, and I'll have my wife's brother arrested.
That was funny.
I guess you just don't realize how clueless the system really is.
Yes, there's some shady shit going down, but trust me, it's fuelled by stupidity!
Look at yourselves.
You know, you pass yourself off as cynical people but you still have some faith in the system, don't you?
I don't.
Well, except for Vinnie. And who gives a shit?
- No way! - Look Either we're right or we're wrong in a giant, giant way.
And if we're wrong, then we got to find someone to help us get out of this trade.
I'm not feeling remotely confident that we're right.
And if we're wrong, who's gonna tell us?
Who understands this stuff? It makes no sense!
I think we need to go to Vegas.
- What's in Vegas? - Vegas?
What the hell's in Las Vegas?
The American Securitization Forum is there next week.
Every bond and CDO salesman, subprime lender and swap trader is gonna be there.
I'm telling you, your bet is against dumb money.
It's about time you find out just how dumb that money really is.
God, I hate Vegas.
I hear the food has gotten really good in Vegas.
They have a Nobu now.
Would you fucking stop it?
Any sense?
And if a bond is "Rich”, it is I don't know, loaded with assets?
"Rich" Just means overpriced.
I can't sleep on planes, so I did my homework.
Okay, let's focus. What's our goal?
To figure out if this is a deal of a lifetime or if everyone here knows something we don't and we're gonna get royally screwed.
Right. Remember that when you meet with the guys from Bear.
I set you up with a face-to-face.
- Awesome. - Where is that?
Holy shit. Five years ago, Securitization was a loser convention.
100, maybe 200 people would show.
$500 billion a year later, you get this.
There's a lot of smug-looking people in here, huh?
It's like someone hit a piniata filled with white people who suck at golf.
I mean, who are all these clowns?
- Oh, come on. I think it looks fun. - Shut up.
Certainly. Vennett says these are the people we're betting against.
- Yeah, here we go. Here we go. - There he is.
Chris, on my left. Chris, on my left.
Gentlemen.
When do we get a chance to face time with some of these lovely folks?
Chris, give him the keycards.
Do you even know which keycards you're giving out?
- You're just giving them out? - Thank you.
First of all, how was your travel? How are you? Uneventful?
- Uneventful. - Okay.
I've been here for six hours. I've already been to the gym, I had two poached eggs and I played blackjack with Harry Dean Stanton.
Thank you for your diary.
Face time. I'd like some face time.
Just remember. We're here to gather information.
We're gathering information, okay?
We're not advertising our short position. All right?
We don't want to spook everybody. Can you do that?
I know you got a big mouth, you like to run it.
Can you just keep it shut for a few days?
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, don't worry. We'll play nice.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Business is good.
Profits are strong and the mortgage continues to be the bedrock on which this economy is built.
And, yes, we had to take some losses in our subprime department last year, but those losses will be contained at only 5%.
Now, in our residential sector Mark, it's not a Q and A.
Our rollout of those variable rate packages were gobbled up by the consumers!
I have a question, please.
Sir, the Q and A is after my statements.
But you know what? You seem anxious. How can I help you?
- Thank you. How are you? - Fine, thank you.
Would you say that it is a possibility or a probability that subprime losses stop at 5%?
Thank you.
I would say it is a very strong probability, indeed.
So back to the residential sector.
When we rolled out the new variable rates package Excuse me.
Yes, sir.
Zero! Zero!
There is a 0% chance that your subprime losses will stop at 5%.
Zero.
Excuse me.
I have to take this.
He must be from Bank of America.
Our subprime department is fine.
No, I'm not doing anything right now.
As I was saying, our residential department How are the kids?
consumers reacted to our packages Mark Baum really did that.
When we were in Vegas, he did that.
He said that, he took the call.
Now you see what I had to deal with?
Yeah, the Beretta Meh.
But this Uzi is fucking awesome!
I need this CDO machine to run for another two years.
And then I'm rich as fuck and I got my house in Aspen.
But do you have any concerns about the performance of the underlying securitizations?
It's easy to see that delinquencies and default rates are on the rise right now.
Could you please stop being such a buzzkill, dude?
We didn't bring you out here to talk about work, bro.
Why did you bring us out here?
Because we need to be able to expense the ammo to a client.
I'm gonna go shoot some terrorists.
Watch how it's done, boys!
These guys are morons.
Fucking tool.
These guys are morons.
Fuck, yes! Boom!
We need to be buying up every swap we can get our hands on here.
Just hold on, okay? Hold on.
My brother's ex-girlfriend works for the SEC.
She just told me she's in town, okay?
So, if we're missing something, maybe she can tell me.
You know, give me some insight.
In the meantime, you go to the main floor and price some swaps.
Well, actually, we're about to invest in housing bonds, and I was wondering if the SEC is worried about them at all.
I know you're not allowed to tell me specifics, but just generally.
Oh, we don't investigate mortgage bonds.
Truth is, since we got our budget cut, we don't investigate much.
Then why are you here? I thought I'm not here for the SEC.
I'm here on my own dime.
I'm floating my resume to some big banks.
How's your brother, by the way?
How are you floating your resume to big banks?
I mean, you're supposed to be the ones, you know, policing the big banks.
Grow up, Jamie.
There must be some kind of law against working for a financial institution right after you've been working in financial regulation, right?
No. No.
Hey! Dougie!
Hey! Come over here. What are you doing at Caesars?
He's at Goldman.
See you.
We can do BBB-level swaps at 500 basis points. Maybe.
You're pricing the swaps like the bond is gonna collapse even though the bond value's going up? Really?
Sign of the times.
What the hell is going on?
Lewis, can you come in early tomorrow, please?
I need to unload the AIG and Countrywide and Freddie Mac positions so that we can afford the premiums on the core mortgage shorts on the swaps.
No problem, Dr. Burry.
- Dr. Burry? - Hmm?
If the investors withdraw, what's going to happen here? Are we done?
Honestly, I don't know.
The bonds aren't going down.
They won't move. It's possible that we are in a completely fraudulent system.
Or You're wrong.
Sure.
It's possible I'm wrong. I just don't know how.
I guess when someone's wrong, they never They never know how.
See you in the morning.
Yeah.
Even Bear upped their prices.
And they keep calling us Brownhole.
You just don't have the money or the reputation.
Don't take it personally.
I don't think I have the strip club in me tonight.
I'm just gonna get some ginger ale and watch some pay-per-view.
I'll book us some flights out for the morning.
A deal. We need a deal, right? A deal.
We need a deal we can afford.
We need a deal that they're not gonna refuse.
So What can we do? We can The AA tranches. What if we bet against the AA tranches?
Who's not gonna take that bet?
We know they say they're 95% AAA-rated, but in reality they're more like 25%.
Some of them are 0%!
We also know that if the bottom tranches fail at over 8%, the upper tranches are affected.
They go to zero.
I'll bet you right now that those AA's are actually like B's.
I rarely ever say these words, but I think Charlie's right.
Look, Ben.
The payoff is 200 to 1.
But they're all taking the ratings at face value.
So they're charging pennies on the dollar a bet against the AA's.
Just when I start thinking you guys are clowns No one on the planet's betting against AA's.
The banks will think we're either high or having a stroke.
They'll take every dime we have to offer.
Kinda brilliant.
This is what we did that no one else thought of.
Not even Baum or Burry thought to short the AA's.
But we did.
Little Brownhole Capital.
We're interested in shorting some of the AA tranche of CDOs.
Come on, guys, what's the angle?
Oh, got no angle. We're new to this. We're just excited.
We want to do $15 million in swaps on the AA tranche.
I don't understand.
You can buy as much AA tranche as you want.
$40 million against the AA.
Brother, I will sell you as much as you want.
You understand perfectly, Bob. You want the deal?
That's cool. That's all right with me.
Pleasure.
Don't do that. Stop. Stop.
- Stop that. - Charlie.
Stop it! Stop.
What?
Do you have any idea what you just did?
Come on. We just made the deal of our lifetimes!
We should celebrate.
You just bet against the American economy.
Fuck, yeah, we did!
Which means Which means if we're right If we're right, people lose homes.
People lose jobs.
People lose retirement savings.
People lose pensions.
You know what I hate about fucking banking?
It reduces people to numbers. Here's a number.
Every 1% unemployment goes up, 40,000 people die. Did you know that?
- No. - Did you know that?
No, I didn't know that.
We were just excited.
Just don't fucking dance.
- All right. - Where are you going?
Whoa, I just got really scared.
First of all, great show today.
- You were terrific. - Thank you.
Your big mouth was a revelation.
I appreciate that.
You worried you and your swaps are getting played?
Well, this is an opportunity for you to meet who you're betting against.
Try not to get too righteous and listen a little.
Okay, fine. Who is this guy?
A real solid-gold asshole.
I'm a CDO manager.
A "CDO manager"?
Yeah, at Harding Advisors.
I didn't realize that there was anything to manage with CDOs.
Oh.
We select the securities that go into the CDO portfolio and monitor the assets.
I do most of Merrill Lynch's CDOs.
Do you represent the investors or Merrill Lynch?
The investors.
You do.
- Yeah. - But Merrill Lynch isn't gonna send you any customers unless you put Merrill Lynch's bonds in your CDO.
Good question. Let's just say Merrill and I have, We have a good relationship.
You have a good relationship with Merrill Lynch.
We've been doing business together for a long time.
And so the CDOs that you create are of the highest quality and the highest value.
- Absolutely. Yep. - Absolutely.
Are you at all concerned about the rising default rates?
I assume no risk for these products myself, Mark.
Okay.
So let me get this straight. The bank calls you up.
They give you the bonds they want to sell.
They give you clients, they give you money to run your business.
Give you fat fees for doing so.
But you represent the investors?
Is that right?
Yeah.
But we're not in the Merrill Lynch building.
- Okay. Where are you? - We're in New Jersey.
You're 20 minutes away.
Well, five if you use a helicopter.
That's funny, huh?
That's hilarious.
Oh, boy.
Your boss is about to explode.
No, he's too curious to explode.
Hold on. Say that again.
CDO "A" Has parts of CDO "B".
And CDO "B" Has parts of CDO "A".
But then they both get put inside CDO "C".
Yeah, that one's called CDO squared.
A CDO of a CDO.
All right?
And then there's CDOs made up of the opposite side of the bet you made with your swaps.
We call them synthetic CDOs.
What did you say? Synthetic CDOs.
That is fucking crazy.
It's not. It's awesome.
His face is starting to boil.
He looks like the bad guy from Dune.
All right, let's say you have a pool of $50 million in subprime loans.
How much money could be out there betting on it, in your synthetic CDOs and swaps right now, tonight?
Let's see, $50 million A billion dollars.
What?
If the mortgage bonds that Michael Burry discovered were the match How much bigger is the market for insuring mortgage bonds than actual mortgages?
About 20 times.
If the mortgage bonds were the match and the CDOs were the kerosene-soaked rags, then the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb with the drunk President holding his finger over the button.
It was at that moment in that dumb restaurant with that stupid look on his face that Mark Baum realized that the whole world economy might collapse.
And I know what you're thinking.
What the fuck is a synthetic CDO?
Well, here's Dr. Richard Thaler, father of behavioral economics and Selena Gomez to explain.
Okay. So here's how a synthetic CDO works.
Let's say I bet $10 million on a blackjack hand.
$10 million because this hand is meant to represent a single mortgage bond.
Okay, Selena has a pretty good hand here, showing 18.
Dealer showing seven.
That's a really good hand for Selena.
Good odds. In fact, her chances of winning this hand are 87%.
So, my odds are good. I'm on a winning streak.
Everybody in this place wants to get in on the action.
How could I lose, right?
Now, this is a classic error.
In basketball it's called the Hot Hand Fallacy.
A player makes a bunch of shots in a row.
People are sure they're gonna make the next one.
People think that whatever's happening now is gonna continue to happen into the future.
During the real estate boom, markets were going up and up and people thought they would never go down.
So people who are watching and think that I won't lose will make a side bet.
Now, this is the first synthetic CDO.
I love Selena Gomez.
I bet you $50 million she wins.
And I'll give you 3-to-1 odds.
3-to-1 odds? Okay, I'll take that bet.
Now, somebody else is gonna want to make a bet on the outcome of their bet.
Bet you 50 million she wins.
That will lead to synthetic CDO number two.
Hey, I bet you $200 million that lady in the glasses wins that bet.
She probably will win. So I want a great payoff.
How about 20-to-1?
Deal.
And this will go on and on with more and more synthetic CDOs.
And we can transform an original $10 million investment into billions of dollars.
You okay?
No.
I actually feel pretty sick.
So I'm going to leave.
You think I'm a parasite, don't you, Mr. Baum?
But, apparently, society values me very much.
In fact, let's do this.
I'll tell you how much I'm worth.
You tell me how much you're worth.
God, you are an incredibly big piece of shit.
Short everything that guy has touched.
I want half a billion more in swaps.
You sure about that? The collateral calls could bankrupt you.
Yeah. Yeah.
Where are you going?
I am going to try to find moral redemption at the roulette table.
Things are worse than I thought.
I honestly think the economy might collapse.
But you've been saying that the system's broken for years, Mark. So Why are you so shocked?
It's more twisted than I could have imagined.
You love to be the virtuous one.
I'm a banker. I'm a part of it.
You always have, Mark. Like
- you're untainted.  - It changed me. It changed me into a person who is not able to reach out to someone He was in pain. My brother was in real pain.
There's no perfect way to help.
It's sad. It's scary.
So stop trying to fix the world.
He told me You're not a saint.
Saints don't live on Park Avenue.
That he was having bad thoughts.
Just feel the feelings like the rest of us.
My first response was to offer him some money.
I offered him fucking money!
His face was so smashed.
That's right.
Michael?
- Michael? - Yes. Yes.
- Is everything okay? - Yes, honey.
- You sure? - Yeah, baby.
I'm fine.
To all investors.
As you may know, our agreement allows me to take extraordinary measures when markets aren't functioning properly.
I currently have reason to believe the mortgage bond market is fraudulent.
So, in order to protect investors from this fraudulent market, I've decided to restrict investors' withdrawals until further notice.
Sincerely, Dr. Michael J. Burry.
I never would have guessed my life could change as much as it has since I moved to L.A.
It's not just, like, that easy to, like, not see you.
He lashed out at rumors he used performance enhancing drugs.
This record is not tainted.
Oh, my God, dude.
Will you please stop changing the channels?
- You're driving me crazy. - All right.
- Fine. - Just put the business news on.
...and the S&P picked up three points.
Jesus!
Mortgage meltdown continued today.
Subprime mortgage lender New Century Financial, once the industry leader, by the way, filed for bankruptcy.
The company immediately Good time for my voice to go Fired 3,200 workers.
The manufacturing index also fell in the month of March It's starting.
A warning that economic growth could slow.
The Institute of Supply Management also reported a rise in prices I'm gonna call my mom.
The principal source of the slowdown in economic growth Time and time and time again, I have gone to bat for you, Mark!
We've known each other for seven years She's got some lungs on her. I'm impressed.
I can't help but enjoy it.
There's no fucking way. There's no fucking way that the big banks are that stupid.
Bye, Kathy!
Well?
Kathy thinks that it would be a good idea if we sold our shorts.
What else is new?
And she said that Morgan Stanley will buy them.
Holy shit!
What did you say?
I told her we're not selling shit.
Uh, if you need the files for 2005... Mr. Fields' suit is very specific to files from the past year.
Good. Then get out. Say hi to Lawrence for me.
Will do.
You can't call me back for a week?
I am so sorry, Mike.
Goldman had a systems failure. I lost a ton of messages.
Yeah, B of A said they had a power outage, and Morgan Stanley said their server crashed.
Huh. That's weird.
Well, I would call it improbable.
So where do you have our position marked?
I think it's the same, Mike.
What? Can you explain that to me, please, because how can the value of an insurance contract not be affected by the demise of the very thing it insures?
They're independent markets. They're not always correlated.
I know it sounds odd, but these are very complicated products.
They are correlated.
They're gonna lose their houses, they're gonna lose their jobs, they're gonna lose their Will you listen to me?
This is like the end of capitalism.
This is like the Dark Ages all over again.
I don't want to talk to Dad.
Okay, I love you, too. Save your money.
She says I need to be on Xanax and double my dose of Zoloft.
I asked Bear Stearns to price our shorts.
They tell me the CDOs still haven't moved.
This is fucking insane!
You realize that?
These people are crooks and they should be in prison.
Look at the ABX.
You can see that the CDOs are worth zero!
So you know what they're doing?
You know what they're doing, right?
Yeah. They're unloading them.
They're selling their dog shit CDOs, then they go to another bank And short the shit they just fucking sold!
Let's go to the press, man!
This is a massive story. Who wouldn't publish it?
Robert Redford!
No, you don't understand!
I got it, guys. I got it.
What am I supposed to do?
Do you want me to write a piece called "We're All Fucked"?
Yes! That's a perfect title!
Casey, right now every bank in town is unloading these shit bonds onto unsuspecting customers.
And they won't devalue them until they get them off their books.
This level of criminality is unprecedented, even on fucking Wall Street.
Jamie And this is me being honest here, okay?
It took me years to build my relationships on Wall Street.
No bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this just because it comes from two guys in a Sorry, garage band hedge fund that thinks it's the apocalypse.
I thought you were for real, Casey.
You know, I'll have to say I really did.
Really?
Yeah, Jamie, you try being for real with a three-year-old and a wife getting her master's degree.
I'm not gonna burn my reputation on your wild hunch.
Thanks for coming, guys.
Totally fucking awesome to see you.
Yeah, Casey. I've always hated you, because you were a prick in college and you are a prick today!
Thanks, Charlie. Still living with your mom?
Charlie, come on!
Mark Baum again. Call me.
Subprime bonds fell off a cliff.
Rumor has it the default numbers are huge.
Who got the remittance data early? I bet it's Goldman.
Yeah, fuck you very much.
Jared, it's chaos down here. Where are we?
"And Caesar wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer".
Shane?
Shane?
Well, nobody's buying CDO or mortgage bonds anymore and everybody wants swaps.
Swaps are now the most popular product on the street.
- That's good for us. - Yes and no.
I heard from somebody who heard from somebody No, Alex, no. Sorry.
Bennie Cleager over at Morgan is taking on some heavy losses in the bond department.
Your ship might be taking on water.
It might be time to get our lifejacket and get out.
I'm jacked.
I'm jacked! I'm jacked to the tits!
Good.
- Do you feel it? - No.
What'd you hear, Tommy?
It's happening.
Everybody wants our swaps.
Kathy's office is looking for you.
They're singing a different tune now, aren't they?
That's not good.
Maybe later. Not now.
- This is a joke. - Never.
Listening.
-Dr. Burry? - Yeah.
Deeb Winston, Goldman Sachs.
Listen, I've been reviewing your position.
I wanted to discuss your marks and make sure they're fair.
Yeah, I think you mean that you've secured a net short position yourselves.
So you're free to mark my swaps accurately for once because it's now in your interest to do so.
I'm not sure what you want me to say.
I think that I think that you've already said it.
You tell Jeff at Goldman that I'm not transferring funds.
This is bullshit!
Okay, we'll talk later.
Thank you.
Thanks for coming so quickly, Mark.
I know you've been hearing rumblings about some losses Morgan has suffered.
- Congratulations. - On what?
Thanks.
Having fun?
Yes.
Tons.
I just wanted you to know that, yes, Morgan has suffered some losses, but our liquidity is strong and there's no cause for concern.
Would Bennie Cleager be concerned?
Because word on the street is that he took some pretty heavy losses.
Kathy, come on. We know each other.
What's going on?
How bad is this?
Okay.
Two years ago, Bennie Cleager in Morgan's bond department also started shorting subprime housing, $2 billion in BBBs.
Bennie is smarter than I thought.
No, he's not smart at all.
The premiums on the swap ate into his desk's profit.
To cover his BBB shorts, he sold a lot of A and AA swaps as protection.
A lot.
He believed that there was no way that they could be affected.
Tell me Morgan Stanley doesn't hold the contracts on these swaps.
Holy shit.
All this time I've been trying to figure out who I'm betting against, and it's Morgan Stanley.
Which is me.
What's your exposure? $3 billion?
Please, don't tell me it's more than four.
I can't answer that. I can't answer that.
Yes, you can answer that, because I walk in here and people are crying in your hallway.
Kathy, you bring me in to tell me everything's fine, and everything's not fine.
What, what is happening?
The long exposure is $15 billion.
Jesus!
He kept saying defaults over 8% were impossible.
Oh, my God.
That there would be a million homeless!
Yeah, but we have nothing to do with Morgan Stanley.
Tell the bankruptcy court.
Morgan fails, all our accounts go on their balance sheet.
It's just crazy.
Morgan makes the sucker's bet and we pay their fucking gambling debt?
Short the bank stocks. Then we wait.
Or we sell our swaps when the market opens.
We get our bonuses, our investors get their profits, we get What, 30 cents on the dollar? It's not bad.
We're three times that.
Not if there's no market left to sell them in.
Forget it. We're not giving out any lifeboats.
If Morgan goes under, we end up with nothing.
Vinnie.
Jesus, come on. I say when we sell.
Look, I get that this is personal for you, but we have a fiduciary responsibility.
No. No, we don't.
Nobody's acting responsible.
Fuck responsibility. Are you kidding me?
The assholes at the big banks will take You boys want any appetizers?
We're talking, please!
- Excuse us. - Sorry.
We are going to wait, and we are going to wait, and we are going to wait until they feel the pain, until they start to bleed.
- That is what I want. - But what about our clients who've entrusted us with their savings I say when we sell.
This isn't about you.
This isn't about you and your Upper East Side
- mahogany soapbox. - Hey! Hey!
I say when we sell!
Whatever you say, Mark.
Dude, did you hear the news?
Okay. So, not only do two mortgage hedge funds backed by Bear Stearns go belly up, but now there's a class-action lawsuit against Bear.
Holy shit!
Let's go! Push! Push!
So, what? Bear could really collapse here.
- This is a risk we really shouldn't take. - Then what?
We bought 80% of our swaps at Bear.
- We'd lose everything. - So what?
- Hey, sir? - One second!
That's my opinion.
We bought these fucking things.
We have no clue how to sell them.
I know. We have to get Ben to do it.
I've been trying to call him and he won't get back to me.
No. He's on vacation with his wife's family.
They're in England.
What?
- Hello, Ben. Hey. - Guys?
Yeah, we're here. Can you hear us?
- Guys? - Yeah, we got you.
Yeah. I hardly got cell phone or Wi-Fi service.
I'm trying to sell $200 million worth of securities.
In a pub. It smells like sheep.
You can do this.
I don't want to pressure you, Ben but if you don't pull this off, we lose everything.
All right. Let's see what Credit Suisse's appetite is.
This is Brownfield Fund.
I want to unload my credit default swaps.
All right. What you got?
Twenty AA tranches of A.B.S. CDOs.
A.B.S.? Are these pretty bad?
Absolutely. They're complete shit.
What's your notional value?
Face value is 205 million. Dollars.
All right, we could, we could go to forty.
No. We want at least 100 million.
100 million? Who are you, a drug dealer or a banker?
'Cause if you're a banker, you can fuck right off!
I don't know if we can make a market.
Just give me your best price?
Yeah. Chuck 100 million in for me, mate.
I think we're far apart.
Look, if you don't want the deal, you can just hang up.
That's what I thought.
It's Dr. Burry.
Looks like the collapse of the financial sector is imminent.
Let's start to sell my position.
It's $1.3 billion.
Sure, I'll hold.
So, I was right.
I took a rash of shit for two years, but I was right.
And everyone was wrong.
And, yeah, I got a bonus check for it. Sue me.
You know?
It's a lot of money. I get it.
I can feel you judging me.
That's palpable.
But, hey, I never said I was the hero of this story.
Hey, Ben. How are we looking?
No. Eighty million.
$80 million, $80 million, that's good, right?
- Eighty is great. - Is that good?
- Eighty is great, Ben. - Okay.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Most of it went to UBS.
You're very lucky. The largest bank in France froze customer's money market accounts today.
This thing's hitting Europe.
Greece and Iceland are finished.
Spain is teetering.
Are you serious? Fuck.
Ben, call us when you get home.
But, hey, before you go, I'm just wondering Why did you do this with us?
You didn't have to.
Thank you. But,why?
You guys said you wanted to get rich. Now you're rich.
Goal!
Pamplona puts themselves on the scoreboard.
As the housing markets and banks continued to hemorrhage, only one of the big shorts refused to sell.
Mark Baum.
So it was beyond perfect when he was asked to speak at a conference opposite Bruce Miller, the famous bullish investor.
After he and Mark had their debate, Alan Greenspan, one of the architects of the whole crisis was scheduled to speak.
Everyone in Mark's office showed up, he even invited friends.
This was the Ali vs. Foreman of the financial world.
The realist versus the fools.
And if it seems almost too perfect, trust me, this happened.
Welcome, everyone. Please give a generous welcome to Mr. Bruce Miller and Mark Baum.
Strap yourself in.
So as some of you may know, Bear Stearns has just received a loan from JP Morgan.
Of course, we're gonna have to wait and see how the markets react, but that should lay to rest any concerns about the bank's health.
Now, I take it you have no plans to sell your $200 million in Bear stock?
No. As a matter of fact, when we're done here, I'll probably go out and buy some more.
For the opposing view, Mr. Baum.
I got to stand for this.
Okay, hi.
My firm's thesis is pretty simple.
Wall Street took a good idea, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bond, and turned it into an atomic bomb of fraud and stupidity that's on its way to decimating the world economy.
How do you really feel?
I'm glad you still have a sense of humor.
I wouldn't if I were you.
Now, anyone who knows me knows that I have no problem telling someone they're wrong.
Bear Stearns is denying rumors of liquidity problems.
Holy fuck, it's 39 now!
We live in an era of fraud in America.
Not just in banking, but in government, education, religion, food, even baseball.
What bothers me isn't that fraud is not nice or that fraud is mean.
It's that for 15,000 years fraud and short-sighted thinking have never, ever worked.
- Jesus, Bear at 37 - Not once.
Eventually, people get caught, things go south.
It's fucking plummeting, man.
When the hell did we forget all that?
I thought we were better than this. I really did.
And the fact that we're not doesn't make me feel all right and superior.
It makes me feel Sad.
Every time I fucking hit "Refresh" It's dropping, man.
And as fun as it is to watch pompous, dumb Wall Streeters be wildly wrong, and you are wrong, sir, I just know, that at the end of the day average people are going to be the ones that are gonna have to pay for all this.
Because they always, always do.
It's 32.
It's fucking tanked, man.
That's my two cents. Thank you.
Let me drop a deuce at Deutsche.
Does our bull have a response?
Only that, in the entire history of Wall Street, no investment bank has ever failed unless caught in criminal activities.
So, yes, I stand by my Bear Stearns optimism.
Mr. Miller, I'm sorry. Quick question.
From the time you guys started talking, Bear Stearns stock has fallen more than 38%.
Would you still buy more?
Yeah, sure, of course I'd buy more. Why not?
Boom.
Jesus Christ!
That concludes the first part of our presentation.
Up next, we have the legendary former chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan.
Folks?
Employees of Lehman Brothers today, as the Wall Street giant's stock went to zero.
The collapse of the venerable New York bank follows a tumultuous few months of market volatility and fear in the world economy.
I got to see inside.
How?
Come on.
I left my phone in the office. I threw my pass out already.
Do you mind if I take your pass?
I don't give a shit anymore. You can do what you want.
Go directly to your transportation.
Do not talk to the press.
After 18 years, I just leave? That's just fucking great!
I'll talk to whoever the hell I want!
Do not talk to the press.
Go directly to your transportation.
Do not talk to Hey, look, you wanna get a bite tonight?
There's this, uh, new Cuban place just opened on the Lower East Side. It's supposed to be good.
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
You and I?
Yeah, or other people.
- That sounds nice. I would like that. - Yeah.
Finally.
Mark, hey.
It's a bloodbath up here.
Morgan stock has lost half its value.
It's down to 23. 10. It's in freefall.
Clients want to talk to you about pulling their money.
It's now or never, Mark. We got to sell.
Mark.
Mark, you hear me?
Mailbox one.
You have 15 messages.
Mike, I can't seem to get ahold of you.
Will you please call me at your earliest convenience.
It's Jack. You're buying stocks?
The market's at an all-time low. This is crazy!
I met my wife on Match.Com.
My profile said, I am a medical student with only one eye, an awkward social manner, and $145,000 in student loans.
She wrote back, you're just what I've been looking for.
She meant honest.
So let me be honest.
The housing crisis represents the greatest financial opportunity of Making money is not like I thought it would be.
This business kills the part of life that is essential.
The part that has nothing to do with business.
For the past two years, my insides have felt like they're eating themselves.
All the people I respected won't talk to me anymore except through lawyers.
People want an authority to tell them how to value things but they choose this authority not based on facts or results.
They choose it because it seems authoritative and familiar.
And I am not and never have been "Familiar".
So I've come to the sullen realization that I must close down the fund.
Sincerely, Michael J. Burry, M.D.
This isn't how I pictured it.
What did you think we'd find?
I don't know.
Grownups.
Mark, you there?
Mark?
Paulson and Bernanke just left the White House.
There's going to be a bailout.
Well, they had to. Right?
Paper markets would've collapsed.
They knew.
Cash would've stopped coming out of ATMs.
They had to backstop this.
They knew the taxpayers would bail them out.
They weren't being stupid. They just didn't care.
Yeah. Because they're fucking crooks.
But at least we're going to see some of them go to jail.
Right? I mean, they're gonna have to break up the banks.
I mean, the party's over.
I don't know. I don't know, Vinnie.
I have a feeling that in a few years people are gonna be doing what they always do when the economy tanks.
They will be blaming immigrants and poor people.
But Mark was wrong.
In the years that followed, hundreds of bankers and rating agencies executives went to jail.
The SEC was completely overhauled.
And Congress had no choice but to break up the big banks and regulate the mortgage and derivatives industries.
Just kidding.
The banks took the money the American people gave them and used it to pay themselves huge bonuses and lobby Congress to kill big reform.
And then they blamed immigrants and poor people.
And this time, even teachers.
And when all was said and done, only one single banker went to jail.
This poor schmuck.
Kareem Serageldin from Credit Suisse.
He hid a few billion in mortgage bond losses, something most of the big banks did on a good day during the crisis.
Mark, can we sell now?
The fund will make almost $1 billion.
You'll clear $200 mil, Mark.
You know, once we sell, we'll be just like the rest of them.
You know that.
No, we're not. We're not the bad guys here.
We didn't defraud the American people and prey on their dreams prey on their dreams of owning a home. All right?
They did.
And now we get to kick them in the teeth.
A billion dollars.
That's right.
But we got to close out our position or it could be zero.
I mean, it's now or never, Mark.
Okay.
Sell it all.
My restaurant's quite small.
And I still cook outside.
However, no one comes to Jay Fai's place for the ambiance.
They come here for the taste.
They come because the food is delicious.
When people think of Bangkok, they may think of a hot, steamy city, full of tuktuks, and endless traffic.
But above all, they think of street food.
Street food is one of the most important aspects of life in Bangkok.
Street food is something that people can talk over, discuss.
"This is my favorite place."
"Oh, you're crazy. That's my favorite place."
Everyone can join in.
Always like a feeling, like there's a party going on.
It's a kind of unifier.
One of the most democratic parts of Thai life.
And then a time when class lines are getting more widened, and everyone's on their phone, and kind of in their own world already.
Street food is like one of the few things left that glues people together.
They want noodles on the way home, or, like, take away curry.
But a couple of years ago, the government decreed that street food would be restricted.
They said the vendors were encroaching on taxpayer's space, and called the vendors "leeches."
But the vendors are there because the people want them there.
So, it's funny that, at the same time, that government is trying to say, "Vendors are just these parasites on society."
There's somebody like Jay Fai.
Jay Fai is probably the most famous street food chef in the world.
And she has long been the Queen of Street Food on the Thai scene.
She takes these common street food dishes, and elevates them into something that they weren't before.
People line up to try her tom yum, drunken noodles, and, especially, crab omelette.
In fact, she's known as "The Omelette Lady" among some people.
She's a 73-year-old woman who manages to grind it out day after day.
People are not doing her a favor by allowing her to take up the sidewalk.
She is doing people a favor by cooking for them.
Even as a kid, I wake up thinking about work.
I'd do it every day if I could.
Every day, I wake up at 10:30 in the morning.
My staff arrives around noon to help.
I'm old, but I always remind them.
"You may be younger, but I am stronger."
By 2:30 in the afternoon, I start preparing myself.
When I walk into my station, I have to be focused.
I am meticulous about every dish that I serve.
Everything must be flawless.
No matter how tired I am, no matter what's going on, I cook every dish myself.
I want it to be the best, because I'm not just a street cook... I'm a chef.
Bangkok is, sort of, at the crossroads.
It's poised to become more modern.
So, the city is trying to clear the sidewalks.
Street food vendors in a lot of neighborhoods are getting told to move elsewhere.
This is, kind of, rupturing an ecosystem that has been in place for decades.
My older brother was the first one to open a noodle stall on Sukhumvit 38 Road.
Back then, over 30 years ago, the place was surrounded by bars.
After the partygoers were finished very late at night, they would come to eat.
We would sell until 4 or 5 in the morning.
Last year, the landlord suddenly shut us down.
Most of our fellow vendors quit and moved back to their hometowns.
But our customers kept calling.
"Hello, hello? Where are you?
Will you start selling again?"
My brother suggested reopening the stall near my house, so it'd be convenient.
Our customers missed us so much that they took taxis just to see us.
Noodles cost 60 baht, while a taxi fare costs over 300 baht!
They were so happy to come out here and eat.
We were so happy to see them.
They used to serve egg noodles with crab claw, but the new clientele can't afford the crab.
Now, it is deep-fried and barbecued pork.
And the egg noodles were silky and buttery, with wontons and greens, and it's still delicious.
They would be considered the lucky ones.
Their customers overcame every possible obstacle to get them to cook for them again.
I grew up in a slum.
In a bad neighborhood behind a market.
Mom sold rice porridge and chicken noodles at the market.
She had to sell a lot of it.
My dad was an opium addict.
Sometimes he ran away. We didn't know where he was.
So I became a seamstress.
I cut fabric all day, rolled them up, and sewed dresses all night.
I made sure we had food on the table.
I spent ten years as a seamstress.
Time flew by when I did this sort of work.
I was content.
However, one day, I was sewing and cutting... Boom! A stairway near me collapsed.
Fire erupted.
Everyone shouted, "Run!"
I ran outside, looked back and everything was gone.
I had nothing left.
After everything burned down, all I had were the pajamas on my back.
My sewing machine and my tools were all gone.
I was in my twenties.
I didn't know what to do.
After that, I started watching my mom sell noodles across the market.
I helped her out back then.
One day, I noticed how slowly she cooked with my sister.
There were only four or five customers standing there, waiting for their food.
I was frustrated.
I told her I wanted to cook.
She told me I couldn't do it.
"Okay, you don't think I can do this?"
That night, I grabbed the wok, I started stir-frying noodles.
I practiced by myself every night, ate that food every night.
At one point, I poured oil into a wok and forgot about it.
When I saw the oil burning, I dumped it all out.
I got so mad, I threw noodles into the pan, and stirred them furiously.
The heat alone browned them nicely.
I didn't need any oil.
They had a wonderful taste and aroma.
The next day, I asked Mom for her wok.
She let me have it.
It was all up to me.
When I started to cook, the customers saw I had talent.
Right then, I began to see my path.
- Are these my rice noodles? - Yes.
Weigh them again.
I need one kilo. This is nearly two.
These mushrooms are quite small.
Just cut them into two pieces, not three.
I love every dish that I cook.
I have no preference or prejudice.
You have to love them to cook them properly, down to every little detail.
Especially, tom yum.
The stock must be rich and tasty, that's very important.
You start with lots of bones to make the broth.
And you just keep adding bones, bird's eye chilies, fish sauce, and lime juice.
Do you know how delicious it is?
-Yes. - Can you recommend another dish?
What about drunken noodles or tom yum?
All right. Let's have tom yum, then.
 Tom yum is this wonderful mix of fresh herbs and natural acidity, I feel like you haven't really had Thai food until you've had tom yum because that's the quintessential Thai dish.
It's spicy, it's salty, it's tart.
And Jay Fai's tom yum is one of the best in Thailand.
It's got fist-sized prawns, juicy cuttlefish, and it's pretty amazing.
But what makes it quite different is that she doesn't just make great tom yum soup, she goes even further.
Jay Fai came out with dry tom yum, which is basically the tom yum without the broth, but with all the aromatics infused with the tom yum flavor.
The first time I had it was the first time I went to Jay Fai and it blew my mind.
It had never been done before.
She takes food that you find on every street corner and she makes it into something really unique.
Selling street food is not that complicated.
They're just out there cooking late into the night.
Just like me when I didn't have a permanent shophouse.
By the time I was in my 30s, I was responsible for my whole family.
I was right on the street.
Chicken noodles, that's all I sold.
We cooked a lot.
Sometimes I cooked until 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. and went to bed at dawn.
Life was very hard.
I had to put all my tables out on the sidewalk.
Sometimes, the authorities would chase us off.
On nights when it rained or when didn't let us put out tables, we were doomed.
I was trying hard to make money, but I was facing a dead end.
I realized I had to do something.
So, I took a risk.
I borrowed some money, and bought some prawns.
Very fresh tiger prawns.
I set the price at 120 baht.
One guy said, "Oh, it's just pad thai."
I told him, "The prawns are totally different."
Don't compare them to anyone else's.
He ate them once.
And when he kept coming back, he never ordered chicken again.
I knew the dish was a success.
I started to look into expensive things like seafood.
Higher quality ingredients meant higher prices.
That's how I got the money to rent my shophouse.
That's it.
In Bangkok, curry is essential.
It's a staple.
It's something that everybody has their own recipe for.
Out on the street, everyone's eating it.
And it's like the perfect comfort food.
No matter where we go, the journey begins with curry.
Jek Pui was my father.
He learned how to make curry when he came here from China.
After my father learned how to cook curry, his relatives told him to bring his family to Thailand and start a new life.
We've been here for over 70 years.
He worked hard developing his recipe.
Sometimes he got it right, sometimes wrong, At 13, I started helping him out.
My father only sold pork and beef curries.
I created our other dishes myself.
We've added green curry with meatballs or chicken, and pork Panang.
If customers loved them, that meant the recipes were right.
Jek Pui makes a really comforting, mild curry.
It has garlic, shallots, chili.
Very few people make it from scratch anymore because it is labor intensive.
That cart, it's a really important part of the community.
There's usually a line of people sitting on red stools, with these bowls of rice and curry perched precariously on their lap.
For everyone who lives in the neighborhood, Jek Pui makes people think of childhood.
Everyone loves that curry on the corner.
Back when I moved into my restaurant... I still called myself a street cook.
I opened my shop in the evenings.
My customers came from bars and gambling joints.
The ones who really loved to eat would gather around to watch me cook.
I saw an opportunity.
Anyone could stir-fry pad thai, I wanted to do something great.
I’d like to cook crab omelettes, but with that dish, I wanted to make something different, too.
So, I taught myself to make Japanese omelettes.
I added a lot of crabs, nearly a pound.
I flattened and rolled them.
When I took my first bite, oh!
Oh, it was so beautiful. I'd done it.
Now, I had something special to sell.
The people are surprised by how important omelettes are to Thai food, but it's a staple dish.
Jay Fai makes it into something that is fantastic and expensive.
With technique, the woks are volcanically hot.
So, if the omelettes are really light, stuffed, full to bursting with chunks of crab meat.
People started to talk about my food. They're coming by.
The gambling houses started calling in lots of orders, dozens at once.
We're serving so many omelettes, sometimes we ran out of eggs.
Is Khun Da here?
Please come in.
From that point on, I started to build a whole new menu.
New dishes just came to me.
Big shots and politicians started to turn up.
They would ask for special things.
There are definitely over a hundred dishes.
We have a lot on the menu.
I'm proud of my boldness and I never regretted it.
At some point, she became known as the best street food cook in the city.
She created destination food from common dishes.
For 40 years, I worked almost every day.
And then, one day, I got a call.
Somebody was hosting a gala dinner.
I don't like to close my restaurant for anything.
But I took the day off for the party.
All of a sudden, my daughter said, "Mom, they called your name."
- I won the award.
The Michelin star.
Right then, it seemed like I couldn't breathe.
I was happy. The happiest.
The next day, there was a big crowd in front of my restaurant.
Everyone wanted to take my picture.
People had to start reserving tables.
My daughter quit her job to help me manage it all.
She didn't need the star.
She knew herself that her food was the best.
The Michelin Star showed the rest of the world what a great, wonderful chef she was.
When chefs started coming to my shop to eat, they called me "Chef."
Wow, I am a chef. Me?
I can't describe how proud I was.
Jay Fai represents a possible outcome for some street food vendors.
If you're good enough, you can bring people to your place, on your terms.
That success surprised the government because they continuously underplay how important street food is.
Not just to Thai people, but in Thailand's image.
Street food is for everyone.
Something purely Thai, purely Bangkok, and purely our own.
Put the bigger chunks in here.
Don't torture the customers.
I've been cooking for a long time.
Whenever anyone asks, I say I'm not tired.
I know my strength.
I have faith in charcoal fires and iron woks.
They taught me to be clever.
They taught me to be brave.
So, if I still have the strength, I will continue cooking.
This is me.
I've always lived my own way, without following the current.
If I were a creature in the ocean, I'd be swimming from the South Pole to the North Pole as a whale.
You have to be strong in order to create your own current.
You can't expect good results if you just go with the flow.
I'm prepared to take on any challenge, head on.
In Japan, good table manners are drilled into us.
The most important one is to say, "I humbly receive" before a meal.
We sit and eat properly to show respect to the life which we consume as food.
In Japan, rules and order are very important.
It's the idea that we must suppress our true intentions to do things properly.
But Osaka is different from the rest of Japan.
Osakans say, "Who cares about appearances? Let's be true to ourselves."
And Osaka is known as Japan's kitchen.
Osakans are known for spending more money on food than other Japanese.
Tokyo people say, "Wow, Osakans really eat a lot!" They are often astonished.
We use the term "eat till you drop."
Osakans have lived this way for 400 years.
And all delicious foods in Japan, originated from street food stands.
The most well-known are takoyaki, okonomiyaki, kushikatsu, and udon.
But street stands are disappearing now due to various regulations.
So these street food stalls have moved inside and evolved into restaurants.
These are itaya-gai from Aoyama, a kind of scallop.
Please enjoy.
Okay! Fatty tuna sashimi!
Yes!
There you go! Right.
Hi, miss. Please stop by at our place.
No flirting!
Control yourself.
Please wash dishes here.
You've got to be kidding me.
We say silly things on purpose.
It's all about making the other person laugh.
That's what makes us Osakan.
And it's what makes Izakaya Toyo so special.
Okay, here you go.
325!
Master!
-Yes! -So energetic.
Here it comes!
I'll be here until I die. I work till I die.
Come on in. Hey, kids!
Okay!
Change this.
Stubborn.
Unreasonable.
Wait a second.
Shut up!
One more!
A magician that manipulates fire.
Many people use a variety of words to describe me.
However, I think of myself as the con artist of Kyobashi, Osaka.
It's okay. I'm always a con artist.
I'm President Trump.
I am small in stature, but you can't judge people by the way they look.
Sometimes I wish, "Please, devil. Come down from heaven and take me!"
-There are times when it is that tough. -Really?
But I change those tough times into joy.
How do you do that?
-Oh! It's... it's burning! It's burning. -Be careful!
Oh, no!
I'm saved by my customers' smiles.
There are parts of the tuna fish that can't be sold raw as sashimi.
If I fried and cooked this part of the tuna, maybe the customers would like it?
What's your best con?
Well, I've fooled most people.
I take this part here, that you would normally throw away, and I turn it into money.
That's my greatest con.
At Izakaya Toyo, I do all sorts of ridiculous things.
I'll be a clown.
I want this T-shirt.
-You want one? -I do.
He keeps saying he wants one of your shirts.
Well, hey... If it's for you... You're like a soccer player, exchanging uniforms.
I'll embarrass myself if that's what it takes.
In this short life, I believe that making people happy is more important than making money.
Thank you for coming here in this heat.
It's a good one.
I want to take a photo with her!
-Really? -I can take it.
Three of us.
But what I love most is... fire and beautiful women.
I was born in a town of 15,000 people.
It's a small island called Kikaijima.
Memories from my childhood are either very happy or terribly painful.
When I was six, my mother died.
I still remember it very clearly.
Then my family fell apart.
My father started drinking and became very violent.
He wasn't an alcoholic, he just drowned himself in alcohol.
Starting at six years old, I was his target.
He would hit me every day.
I'd get home from school, grab a pillow and blanket and go to the rooftop of my elementary school or the end of a pier.
My father, though a sailor, couldn't swim.
My favorite time at elementary school was having the delicious school lunch with everyone.
Father, then, said, "No more lunch, we can't pay."
I was miserable.
I would go home alone and pick weeds from the fields to make a stir-fry.
I can't say my meals tasted good.
I ate to fill my stomach.
It was more like survival.
In Japanese culture and tradition, we appreciate those who are older than us.
We appreciate our grandparents and our ancestors.
Mr. Kita's shop is the second oldest takoyaki shop in Japan.
For takoyaki, you make a flour-based batter pour it into an iron plate with half circles and add pieces of octopus.
The tempura flakes are very important.
My great grandmother started Umai-ya out of a food stall.
We've never changed the flavor of our takoyaki.
We can't change our recipe because our customers expect a certain flavor.
Mr. Kita's takoyaki has about five textures!
In your mouth, you get this "What? Wow!" experience.
I was going to college, but in Japan, the first-born son takes over the family business.
So, I made the big decision to take over my family business of 65 years.
I work with my mother.
At the shop, she is more like a business partner.
I think tradition is very important.
I'm hoping to continue until our 100th anniversary.
I haven't thought about after that, though.
I wanted to go to high school but we couldn't afford it, so I went to Osaka to work.
I was 15, and it was spring.
The amount of people and cars was the most shocking thing.
People told me "Osaka is a scary place."
"A fun place."
"It's also a place that makes dreams come true."
-I'll have some fish roe again, please. -Sure.
I worked as a dishwasher at my aunt's bar called "Marushin" for two years.
After my third year, I started cooking there.
The senior chefs taught me all sorts of things.
But I knew I was capable of doing more.
I had a strong desire to have my own business.
I see a real big one.
Yes, we got big ones, the kind you like.
They're cheap today.
Cheaper than usual. This one is big, too.
The second one.
This one?
Can I exchange this one?
If you insist.
Exchange with whatever you want.
You know, you're lucky.
You can't tell anyone, though!
I set a goal to start my izakaya once I saved up 11,000,000 yen.
"Better be the head of a chicken than the tail of a bull."
Rather than being the underling of a big company, I wanted to be the boss of a small food truck.
Don't be a bull's tail. Be a chicken's head.
My dream when I started working in Osaka was not only to open my own shop, but to buy my own house, get married, and have kids.
I kept telling myself, "I'm going to work harder than anyone else and start Izakaya Toyo, no matter what!"
I had just celebrated working ten years at the izakaya, and I finally saved up 11,000,000 yen.
I thought, "Yes! Finally, I can open my own shop!"
My father died.
There was a need for a funeral and grave.
In my home town of Kikaijima, traditions like funerals and graves are very important.
It cost 7,000,000 yen for his funeral and grave.
All that was left was 4,000,000 yen.
I have no regrets, but my dream was crushed.
In the 1900s, during the Taisho and Showa periods, wheat flour first spread among the general public.
People would place griddles in front of their house, add water to flour, and cook a thin layer of batter.
That's how okonomiyaki started.
You can use toppings that you like, but in Osaka we like okonomiyaki with strips of pork.
I think for Osakans, we'd proudly say that okonomiyaki is our soul food.
Okonomiyaki is made of cabbage, green onion, tempura flakes, ginger, and we use my grandmother's special batter.
I can't share the details of that part.
This shop has seen success, thanks to my grandpa and grandma's efforts.
I work with my dad.
He scolds me sometimes.
It's not easy, but this is my favorite job.
That's it.
The only people you can count on in life are your parents.
My parents passed away already.
I could only rely on myself.
I knew I couldn't expect good results if I gave up on my dream.
Using that 4,000,000 yen, there must be a way to start my izakaya.
I thought, "I should ask the owner of the parking space I rent."
That's how Izakaya Toyo started.
I opened my izakaya on November 20th, 1992.
In the beginning, I just put a stainless board on top of the truck bed.
And it became my cooking table and counter.
I could only accommodate five to six customers at a time.
It was self-service.
Even my customers used to help by washing their own dishes after their meal.
Hey, please take care of this.
Okay.
At first, society looked down on me, saying "your izakaya is just a food stall."
I felt inferior because we didn't have a bathroom or running water.
Please give me green onions, too. Please wait a moment.
Okay, please start drinking beer.
There's no ice.
I'll get it.
Sorry, guys.
Put this away.
Put this there.
In the beginning, I was extremely worried whether I could keep the izakaya running.
I worked non-stop for 50 days with 4 hours of sleep each night.
And I never took a bath.
I'd get home in freezing weather, and I didn't have hot water, so I'd wipe my body with cold water and soap.
I really thought, "There must be no one experiencing life worse than me."
Let me know if you are not getting your food!
Hey, if you're just hanging out, listen to the customers!
Listen to their troubles.
Yes.
Keep it moving!
Especially in the first year, I couldn't afford to make customers wait a long time.
I used a blowtorch for tuna because it allowed me to cook faster.
At first, I used a very small blowtorch.
My friend saw this blowtorch and said, "I'll bring you a bigger one that you can attach to a propane tank!"
I thought, "This is great, I don't have to keep customers waiting long."
I dip my hand in ice water quickly and cook while wishing, "May it be delicious! May it be delicious!" with my whole heart.
Cooking with my hands under the flame, I can avoid tearing the tuna with metal tongs.
Ma'am, thank you for coming as always.
Your grandson is huge.
You are confused.
Go senile and drop dead.
Word of mouth made Izakaya Toyo famous.
And on the third year, 100 people lined up.
What do you think, Toyo?
-Oh, me? -Yes.
Oh me, I'm not working hard.
You are!
I'm just being swept along by the tides of time.
Okay, good work.
Wipe the head, too.
Okay, thanks.
But it finally felt as if I had a real izakaya... when we got running water and we installed a bathroom.
"Look, it's a proper bar!"
Better be the head of a chicken than the tail of a bull."
Your health is your own responsibility.
Did you catch a cold, no appetite, too tired?
That's your own fault.
Carve that into your brain, okay?
Great job, everybody.
-Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir!
My izakaya succeeded.
It's true.
Osaka is a city that makes dreams come true.
Tradition and family are cherished here in Japan.
I have kids.
If they want to commit to making our takoyaki, I would love for them to take over.
I know I need to grill thousands to get close to my dad or grandpa's flavor.
In the future, while protecting our recipe and flavor I'd like to add my own special twist.
All the best food in Japan started off as street food.
Nowadays, these dishes from Osaka are well-known around the world.
That's how famous Osakan food is.
It's "eat till you drop."
Like Osaka, I don't fit in any box.
I am proud of that.
In the past, my desire was to buy my own house, get married and have kids.
But when you create your own current, life can be unpredictable.
Izakaya Toyo is my home.
My staff are my children.
My customers are my family.
And that's how it is.
I live my life with no regrets.
I'll continue working until I die.
Whether it's tomorrow, or when I'm 90.
My greatest wish is to keel over while working.
That's all.
Welcome to the global archive, a vast storage structure located 800km north of Norway.
It contains the artwork from every national museum.
There are pickled animals stack up two by two.
Every film, every book,every scientific report, all stored on banks of servers.
But the conditions we are experiencing now, were actually cause by our behavior in the period leading up to 2015.
In other words, we could've saved ourselves.
We could've saved ourselves.
But we didn't, it's amazing!
What state of mind were we in?
To face extinction, and simply shrug it off?

I was at London at the time, where Stelios Haji-loannou,he created the EZ jet, and I was fascinated with basically how he did it.
Evacuate, evacuate.
Go this way, go this way.
We've been offering fares from 600 rupees,all the way down to 1 rupee.
How many people can afford a 1 rupee fare?I would imagine every single Indian can.
That a rickshaw driver can, and servants.
In year 2005, having a elite class who can fly in a country of a billion people, it's ridiculous.

Extraordinary to think that these are the Alps in December.
Here in Chamonix is across the Alps, there's a dramatic lack of snow and exceptionally warm temperatures.
It is a glimpse into the future.
More than half of ski resort in Europe could shut down in the next 50 years because of global warming.
So nobody goes skiing, big deal. The thing is it's not bad, is it? That's the whole point.
He fact you can't get skiing anymore or the glaciers are melting is not really the point, the point is that signals that basically the earth is destabilizing.
And all the norms that have allowed life to exist are changing.
List climate change,major events, up to the present day.
This is a couple of days before Katrina struck.
Most people are following the evacuation order in getting out of the city.
But New Orleans-borne Alvin DuVernay had no intention of moving.
I got up at Saturday morning and there's a buzz in the neighborhood, everybody were running around and I was like what's up?
You know, the hurricane's coming.
I checked on the web and sure enough all of the models had it, aiming right for us. Bulls eye.
This is a monster, and it's coming.
Walk through the house a few times,putting things up.
My silk rug from Nepal up on the top shelf, and my guitar, I mean,you just do these things.
I mean another way to do that is get all you stuff and go, that's option 1, probably the best option.I didn't grow up in that option.
Alvin collected his 84-year-old father than barricaded the two of theminside this house as the hurricane approached.
You stare Mother Nature in the eye, usually she's fairly benign.
And she comes along,methodically, ruthlessly.
And then she stands toe to toe,and dares you, dares you.
Go ahead and get your best equipment,now, go ahead, do it, let's dance.
I think ones got to be very careful about attaching a particular event to global warming.
But nevertheless the intensity of hurricanes is related to surface sea temperature, so increased intensity of hurricane is associated with global warming.
By first light, the water in Alvin's house is chest-deep and still rising.
So he helped Alvin Sr. into their boat and headed for dry land.
There's just one boat that's floating, so it's no big deal to launch the boat, it's launched.
There's no landmarks, really, to speak of that's a real different perspective, driving through your neighborhood at tree level.
Then, all of a sudden you realize there is a lot of people who stayed behind.
There's no coastguard or police .
Most of our national guards were elsewhere in the world, Iraq, Afghanistan.
Alvin rescued 200 people,and their pets, over 2 long days, including a 95-year-old man and a six-week-old baby.
That little basket came out of the window,that was a pretty special time.
And just as peaceful eyes-closed, it just stops you, in your tracks, dead stop, take a breath, you know, there's nothing more precious than that.
Alvin's neighbors were the lucky ones, hurricane Katrina was America's worst weather related event to that date.
And it was just a taste of what was to come.
"It is our fault," after years of debate, some of the world's top scientists.
"Unequivocable," this the word they used, human activity is.
Contributing to changes in our earth climate,and that issue is no longer up to debate.

Despite all the efforts to control pollution and its effect in our climate, the level of greenhouse gas emission has reached a record highand shows no signs of being reversed.
Despite the Kyoto treaty, and all the talk of reducing emission of carbon dioxide, level of this key greenhouse gas are rising faster than ever.
6:30 am on a cool autumn morning,and Alvin's heading up to work, searching for more oil.
Ironically, the oil infrastructure off the coast of New Orleans suffered major damage during the hurricane, but Shell moved fast to carry out repair and just 9 months later, the rigs are online, and everyone's back at work.
Oil was formed when ancient plant life in the ocean absorbed energy from the ancient sun.
When these plants died, they settled in the ocean floor along with the dead bodies of tons and tons of ocean creatures.
Over millennia, temperature increased and the organic matter was gradually cooked until the sun's energy was stored inside oil.
150 million years later, Shell's geologists analyzed where the oil might be, and then drilled 3 miles down into the seabed to collect samples.
We get the samples and analyze them for the fossil contents. The microscopic fossils.
And it's just another geo-scientific tool in order to improve your possibility of finding oil.
In my opinion, probably arrogantly so, but it's pretty high calling actually to try to do that, to try to figure out or maybe take apart,time itself.
Go back a few thousand years, The energy available to grow our crops or feed animals was limited by the daily sunlight falling on the earth.
But now, we gorge ourselves on hundreds of years worth of sunlight every single year.
Every part of modern life is now literally made of oil.
From CDs to plastic bags,to medicines and computers.
From clothes and carpets to hair gel and cell phones.
It's a fantastically useful substance.
Then there's our food, each calorie we eat used about 80 oil calories to produce, package, refrigerate and transport.
And fossil fuel produce fertilizers now feed about 2 billion people who could not otherwise stay alive.
It would be wise for humanity to use the remaining oil to build the new society which could run without it.
But we are, instead, indiscriminately burning tens of millions of barrels every day.
It'll all be gone in about 40 years,leaving pretty much none for future generations.
And then you see it,and you smell it, and, you know, it's greasy and ugly and smell so much like money, it's just beautiful.
13 billion pounds in 2005, that's 1.5 million pounds an hour, 400 pounds a second.
And a hefty chunk of those profits came from here, Nigeria, where most of the population lives on less than 1 dollar a day.
This is the water we drink.
22-year-old Layefa Malin has an ambition to trained as a doctor and then work in a home village called Cojabanee, where Shell started building this medical center.
Like hundreds of other community projects across Niger delta, construction has been abandoned.
Shell maintains that's because of the risk of kidnapping.
13% of the oil revenue is supposed to be spent on community development.
But the local people share is almost all lost to the corrupt political system.
So despite being in the most profitable oil region in West Africa, Layefa's village has no health service,no secondary school, no electricity, and no drinking water.
Layefa is describing a phenomenon known as "the resource curse".
Paradoxically, finding oil usually increases a country's poverty.
As the oil wealth is concentrated in hands of a few, so the agriculture, education, and health system of the country become neglected and often collapsed.
The local people health problems are compounded by gas flare, burning nights and days throughout the Niger delta, asthma, bronchitis, skin diseases, and cancer have all been linked.
That gas is found alongside oil,but, as it's dangerous to transport, it can't easily be sold to over sea markets. It could be use for cooking and heating within Nigeria, but building infrastructure is expensive so the oil company just burn it off.
Its flares emit about 70 million tons of carbon dioxide every year more than the annual emissions from 10 million British homes.
So they just do whatever they like.
Why are American cities designed so it's almost impossible not to have a car?
Why were a hundred railways in cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angles bought up and then deliberately destroyed?
Why do the electric cars get scrapped?
Why were we, along with Australia,the only two countries not to sign the original Kyoto climate treaty?
Why was an oil company lobbyist allowed to change official government reports on global warming?
Why was the same PR firm employed by the tobacco industry to persuade the public that smoking is healthy, then employed by the oil industry to convince us there was still doubt about climate change?
Alternative energy has been available for 50 years, why have we barely used it?
Why were solar panels taking off the white house?
Because right from the early days of the industry, the oil men and their unseen profit have had an unhealthy influence on the people running our country.
And now, they all are the people running our country.
And they're providing the cash.
Oil business isn't just in bed with the government, it is the government.
Here, Layefa is going to a nearby village, Oiama, that was massacre by the government.
The village was involved in a dispute about ownership of a piece of land, on which Shell planed to drill for oil.
The government claimed that the village was harboring terrorists, and when they sent the military in to find those terrorists, the villagers opened fire on the soldiers.
Amnesty international investigated the massacre and concluded that, although the government was responsible for the killings, Shell Nigeria should have made sure that their activities did not contribute to the conflict.
They burned them off.
Human history is littered, with the corpses of people who had stuff worth stealing.
Animals, water, shinny things, fertile land, spices.
Nutmeg slice, tea?
But when it came to stuff worth pinching one continent had it all, ivory, copper, cotton, rubber, wood,tin, gold, diamonds, and people.
As cheap energy, slaves were unbeatable, until the less troublesome energy source was discovered, and the new era began.
Human numbers increased 5 times over.
And with each person wanting more and more stuff, oil became "the resource" worth fighting for all around the world.
Well, you want to know the real reason why to warn Iraq?
According to the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, it's a simple, 3 letter answer.
You might read the ex-chairman of Shell that said over weekend that oil can hit over 150 dollars a barrel as world production begins to peak, not really good news for a country whose entire economy, not to mention its entire way of life, is based on cheap oil.
Throughout our history, the deal was we left the world in a better place, then we found it, that was progress, the wheel, rule of law, penicillin.
It was our covenant to our children, grandchildren.
My children went angry with me for breaking the covenant, they were too busy trying to stay alive to waste energy on blame, trying to negotiate their way through food riots,refugee camps, and the collapse of society.
But I think my grandchildren would have been angry, had they survived into adulthood.
Skiing in desserts, heating the air, lighting empty offices, energy is so ridiculously cheap it makes perfect economic sense to just pick it away.
China is new bad guy, because they're building a new power station every 4 days.
But the quarter of that energy makes stuffs for us.
Western company pay Chinese workers crap wages to make crap plastic toys, then ship them to Europe,and wrap them in more plastic.
Punters drive to the out-of-town megastore in their gas-guzzlers.
Plastic toy and plastic box goes into plastic bag.
2 days later, toy broken, and back it goes to a Chinese landfill where it stays for about 50 thousand years?
Water from the bottle's much better than the tap.
800 times more energy wasted and 10,000 times more expensive for you.
It's a tricky decision?
Lots of ideas have tried to take over the world, but there's only one winner.
3000 adverts bombard us every day.
Telling us we'll be happier,more atracttive with better skin, if only we buy their product.
To get there, they create incentives and insatiable desire to buy more and more stuff.
Americans have been advertised that longest, and they now each consumed twice as much energy as an European, 9 times more than a Chinese person, 15 times more than an Indian, and 50 times more than someone from Kenya.
If all the 65 billion here on earth consumed like European or Japanese, we need two more planets worth of resources.
If everyone consumed like American or Australian and Canadian, we need another four.
And in 2040 or so when there are about 90 billion of us, we need two more again.
Capitalism's only goal is ever expending growth, but ever expending growth on just a one not expending planet.
It's impossible.
The con economic system is disastrous, not just for the planet, but for most people, too.
400 years of capitalism has allowed the richest one 1% to take 40% for themselves, leaving just 1% for the poorest to have.
But anyone wanting to live differently is fool ticket every time.
With profit, the only measuring step, destroying the planet is written into the system, and run away climate change is not very surprising result.
The logo effectively is color,light grey, orange telecom, they are orangey black.
Our logo is fluorescent color.
Where everything changes in economy in minute, you have an airline moving in.
Because people can basically do business alot faster, if businesses grow a lot faster,people have more disposable income, then, you know, consumerism sets in, and you know where the verge where base consumerism is setting in, just moving a lot like America.
Here, Jeh travels to Airbus headquarter in France, as they'll be supplying him with 26 planes in his first 3 years.
We have only 200 aircrafts commercially flying in India, China has 800.
Ultimately, we have a very long way to go, playing catch up with China catch up with Europe, or, you know, say, America one airline South West, has 417 aircrafts.
That's double the amount of aircrafts we have as a country.
You know, we simple sentence for me, summarizes it all.
Thing is gonna get better.
In my main house,is has 10 feet of water in it, marinated in that sludge for 3 weeks, almost.
So it's current state of my house, it's been demolished.
It's flat piece of a property waiting for another house to go on that.
I lost everything, everything that i owned, I mean everything from family heirlooms to the paper towels sitting on your kitchen counter, in everything in between, it goes on and on.
Two beautiful, beautiful oak trees I did not lose, you know, local, indigenous,quikes, virginianas, live oaks that sprawl all over the place,beautiful, beautiful things.
That's what I have left, two old oak trees and an empty lawn, everything else is gone.
That sucks.
Losing everything you have,it's so overwhelming.
And the grief that comes with that, it is just profound.
We have an unspoken collected pact to pretend climate change wasn't happening, as though as long we ignore it hard enough, It wouldn't be true.
Not absolutely everyone,a few were shouting fire.
Hello, come on in.
One of the greatest difficulties with climate change is that the effects of our emissions today are not actually realized in terms of the temperature for 30 or 40 years so there is this time-lag system.
Which makes it difficult for us,humans, to respond because we're evolutionary equipped to deal with the very immediate threats like advancing armies or dangerous animals.
We're not so well-equipped with dealing rationally with very long term problems like climate change.
So we have to act now to stop something happening in the future, if we wait until the full temperature effects are already upon us, then it's far too late to stop.
If you remember one single number above all else, make it two degrees, now everyone in the world pretty much, the European Union, big multi-national corporations,Greenpeace, political parties, all agreed that we have to stabilize global temperatures within 2 degrees above pre-industrial level, and the reason for that is because, if you cross that threshold,the narrow tipping point in the earth system, which could drive the warming process essentially out of control.
Huge amount of carbon could be coming out of the world, trees and soils, methane could be coming out of the perma-frost in Siberia and it's that extra input of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which then leads us up to the worst case scenario to 6 or more degrees and the eventual wipeout of most of the life on earth.
So power emission has been going up, between, let's says, 1950, and now they need to level out, stabilize, and then decline just as rapidly to sustainable levels about an 80% cut by 2050.
But crucially, to keep the temperature rise within 2 degrees, this point of stabilization need to be at around 2015.
And so that means, really, the time,timeline we've got, ticking clock, is that we have to stabilize global emission within just 7 years from now as we speak 2008.
And scale of this task to achieve a transformation to a low carbon economy of the entire,entirety of human civilization, is obviously, is huge, monumental task,probably the greatest humanity ever faced.
Remember the English family who went to see the glacier?
They're back home in Cornwall,south west England, inspire to start tackling their own energy wasting.
It says that the average Individual in the UK responsible for emitting 10 tons of greenhouse gas a year.
They're calculating exactly how much climate-change-gases their family currently produces, and how it can be reduced.
Yeah, but that's the average individual, there are five of us.
Whichever way you look at this,it isn't good.
We produce about half of our food, and we try keep our consumption of meat and dairy down.
My car runs on chick fat and we do cycle when we can.
We just got our wind turbine,which will produce all our own electricity.
We're aiming to cut down to about one ton each per year, which is apparently the sustainable amount that the world's trees and plants can reabsorb.
But the big problem is flying,just one mid-term flight, say, London to New York, would blow our entire carbon budget for about 3.5 years.
Apparently, other than setting fire to a forest, flying is the single worst thing an ordinary individual can do to cause climate change.
So, it's a bit of a dilemma, because we've just been invited to go skiing in France.
Then I am flying from Newquay,which is our nearest airport, 40 minutes from here, to Bergerac, which is like, you know, an hour and a half or something, from it.
And literally we could leave here in the morning that's we leave like in, Cornwall, we could leave Cornwall in the morning, and be in Bergerac by sort of,for lunch, after lunch.
But if you actually think, this is going to cause the death of people, actually in effect.
People are make that direct connection, then it's a really scary thought.
Obviously, us not flying to France or not flying,wherever it's hard to guess, will solve the problem.
But it's down to what you think it's the correct thing to do.
Because everyone else's doing it,that is not a good reason to do anything.
To look at the terrible things in our history that everyone regrets now, massacres, the holocaust a lot of that , was just going a long way what was the predominant thinking at the time.
I almost jealous at the time, 5 or 10 years ago when I could just jump on a plane with impunity, I didn't even think about it,it's blissful,no moral dilemmathere,whatsoever.
Needless to say,they didn't take that flight.
And joining the climate change protest march may not be everybody's idea of the 10th wedding anniversary, but Piers and Lisa have share ideals from the moment they met.
My friend, we went along to the party together, and she just basically took me straight over to Piers.
And that was it, that was it. We just and spent the whole evening talking about wind turbines.
Piers has been developing wind farms in Africa,America, and Britain for over 15 years.
But he knows that they only help slow the climate crisis as a small part of a total reordering of western society.
And there still is an idea that somehow we have to find the solution, the silver bullet.
No single renewable source is going to be the solution, absolutely not.
And Piers doesn't think much of the other option, whereby everyone crosses their fingers and hopes that the miracle technology will be invented in time.
I'm not saying we shouldn't be developing other stuff, absolutely, we should be.
We should be throwing everything after it.
But, you've got to make use of what's available now.
And in the UK, we've got a great wind resource, and we just got to bite the bullet and go for it.
Piers has purposed a new wind farm as airfield farm at Airfield Farm in Bedfordshire, central England.
He could have 15 turbines installed and generating 13 megawatts of electricity within a year.
The process balloon is now going up, but while that's happening, I'll just explain where we are.
This is the site of an old world war two bomber base phone.
We all have our thumb down as well.
UK-wise surveys point to about 70 ~ 80% in favor of wind farm as a concept.
The difficulty is when you got one on your own doorstep, and then there is the sort of "not-in-my-backyard" syndrome.
Jim, what's the problem?
The problem really is that this is one of the least windy sites in the country.
I hope it's not gonna get too windy tomorrow and it wraps itself around the church.
Well, I live in Coddington, and we're going to be absolutely surrounded by these high moss.
They're going to obliterate the view.
What it normally always comes down to with wind farms is the aesthetics, you know.
Everything else is basically put together to try and back up the ultimate thing, the ultimate thing is they don't want to spoil their view.
But I'm bit concern about the low level noise as well.
The wind farm site is right next to world famous Santa Pod drag-racing strip.
Anybody you ask it, nobody's against wind energy, that's the point against inappropriate wind energy use.
Hypnotic, you're driving alone, and you tend to saw this sails revolving, and you're not concentrating on the driving.
Eurney Braddock will benefit financially having turbine on his farm, but now he's in conflict with his neighbor, Victoria Reeves.
Everyone is very unhappy about it,we're gonna lose the value of our properties, we are not going to be able to sleep, it will make a difference, Eurney you have no idea, believe me.
According to Victoria, they stop to wind farm up in Scotland on the other estate in Scotland.
Back in the mid-90's that was a great victory.
"It can't rely on the wind, it can only deliver ", "It's an additive. "
"Additive? Do you mean additional? Yes, it is additional. ""It's a economics resources, put it that way. "
"No, Eurney, it doesn't. It's got to, it's got to.It does nothing of the sort, believe me. "
It's an emotional campaign, it's about fear mostly based on complete BS, frankly.
But never mind, facts are not a problem.
"It's a fair fight, and I hope you lose. ", "Alright. "
This is august 2005, just after Mumbai's worst ever floods.
And a couple of months before Jeh's first flight.
Show daddy how good you ride this,show daddy how fast you can go, come on.
Wooo no more pushing, it's battery operated.
"So, I can't finish either." "Hey, grandpa "
Jeh is descended from one of India's richest and most powerful business dynasties.
They pioneered everything from ship building from the 18 centuries to internet services in the 21st.
And around about way, his privileged up bringing sparked the idea for the low cost airline.
What do you want me to do?I'm going to the airport.
Hroughout basically my life, at young age, I used to hang out with tons of servants' kids. You know, that sort of stuff.
When you go home,you suddenly think, why do I have so much,and these guys have nothing.
And that sort of, and that constantly adding up.
Everyone is here for a purpose.
The idea is to realize what your higher purpose is,and then realize how you gonna fulfill it.
And eventually I realize what my higher purpose was, it was to insure that I eradicated poverty.
Jeh volunteers at the charity which helps villagers lift themselves out of poverty.
But even by private jet and jeep, it's a 5 hour, 900 kilometers journey.
Hiring a private jet is basically in terms of costs as much as the village does, you know, take a village from below the poverty and put it above the poverty.
So effectively, in terms of it defeats the purpose.
And therefore I decided to try the trains, from Bombay takes about 26 hours.
I said to myself, "wow,this is incredible. "
People pay good money and still have to basically put with this rubbish.
15 million people travel by trains in India every single day.
Jeh's dream is to get them all off the trains and into the skies.
We're not at war at the moment. It's not a war.
But people actually recognize that full implications of what's in store for us, they would be treating it like a war.
If anybody takes Airfield Farm for example, I mean that was the year it was airbase, people flew out there and died.
Of course, which was massive at the time,the global problem, and we have ourselves out.
A real global problem that needs that kind of level of commitment.
There are many, many other industries that need to be looked in to first, before aviation.
It's not questionable choosing one industry to target, in ultimate deal, we all contribute to greenhouse gases, we all contribute to the crisis that we have today with the planet.
So ultimately, in terms of, you know insuring our planet is safe and healthy is each one's job, task.
Whether you do it in your own way by using less tissue paper, using less papers, less trees cut buying green cars or not flying.
Obviously, if you're not doing it,and the demand goes down, the demand goes down, the supply goes down.
Life is about demand and supply or supply and demand.
Strange. Watching this film fragment.
Like looking through binoculars observing people of far of beach.
Running around in circle, fixated on the small area of sand under their feet.
As a tsunami races toward the shore.
Here's Alvin. He's just taken early retirement after thirty years on the oil industry salary.
And he's planning to spend his later years outside enjoying nature.
Oh, certainly I'm ecologist, and an environmentalist.
I really don't have a problem squaring.
Working for an oil company that I feel done a pretty good job and in being environmentally friendly.
When I started working in the oil industries, about the mid 70's, it was clear path for me,as a scientist coming up college.
I didn't know the detail of what goes on in the oil industry, the goods and the bad.
But indeed every industry has that, goods and bad.
Would I do it again, knowing what I know now,of course I would do it again, I mean, you need to work,you need to do something.
The worst example I've had is a lady, an old lady came up to me,at the public exhibition.
And gave me a cutting from a newspaper,with a picture of guy being shot.
Local anti-campaign is one of the key factors, stopping about 80% of the proposed wind energy project in Britain.
Had they all been built, 10% of our Electricity would've been non-polluted.
How the heck are we meant to persuade people in India and China that they should develop in a more sustainable way when we are not prepared to even to accept you know, the old wind farming landscape.
"So how's it going?", "All right, yes. "
"Not too much trouble?", "Not really,no, nobody's punched me up. "
Pierce has come back to the Ernie's farm with a plan to make the turbine less visible.
Trying to kick start the planning process that the anti-campaign has now held up for eighteen months.
Another eighteen months of climate change.
Another eighteen months,where I'm able to do nothing about it.
You must be feeling the same as me.It just, I mean how long have we got.
Pierce's compromise reduces the number of turbines from fifteen down to nine.
This is still the equivalent electrical power to fair eleven thousand homes.
So there's still alot power.
Exactly the opposite is happening,to the very thing that needs to happen.
These things need to be speeded up,and actually, they're getting slowed down.
Plenty of politicians are talking about it,but when it comes down to it, It's just not happening.
Governments will only go as far as the population demands.
And that means mass protest on unprecedented scale.
Direct action like this is essential, if you were going to turn an issue around in a short period of time.
We've found that many many times in the past,from the suffragettes onwards.
The very fact that the crisis is taking place in our generations is happening right now, means we are tremendously powerful people.
So this position of despair,and I can't do anything, there's no point.
It's completely illogically,it's exactly the opposite.
There's no shortage of great matter in the species, we can do some amazing things.
But I don't think we been very smart about how we use our resources.
How we quite literally burn up something as beautiful and useful as all.
We literally burn it up.That's it, it's gone, it's done.
I think most people were becoming disenchanted by this point.
We'd stop believing that this was the golden era of human civilization, and started questioning our collective values.
All I can hope is,an incredible disasters like Katrina, and the horrible wars comes out and what not, that are going on around the world will snap us out of it.
Let's see if it's headed in the right direction for the good of mankind.
For this disaster, I had a lot of stuff,I was a classic consumer.
Two years later, I've learned lot about happiness and the pursuit thereof.
The happiness is not in the latest gadgets,the latest electric tooth brush, or something like that.
All of that stuff. It's just not the stuff of life. Not for me anyway.
Climate scientist can estimate how much of the remaining fossil fuels we can safely burn.
This amount is called the "global cap. "
Under this proposal, the world governments will make a binding into international agreement detailing how to distribute the global cap.
The earlier the start takes, of greater the chance of not triggering runaway climate change.
The total global emissions for the first year say 2012, will be set for that current level.
Every year following they'll shrink until by about 2065, they're almost zero.
Initially, each country would be allocated an emissions quota, according to how much they currently consume.
But this would change over time America would slash its emissions 90% from its current over consuming position.
Europe too would decrease massively, as would China.
But India and Africa would increase until by about 2025.
Each human being on the planet would have equal rights to the earth's resources.
Equity is the only option morally, and also practically as the developing countries won't sign up for anything less.
But total emissions would then keep decreasing every year.
Until by 2065 we'll have waned ourselves off of fossil fuels and prevented the worst impacts of climate change.
As to how each country divvies up its share to the system, there were various options on the table.
The most promising of which individual carbon rationing.
Mr. W.S Morrison is here to explain.
If in the culture of war, we are short for a time of this or that article of food.
Rationing, will give every one,rich and poor alike, an equal share of all its goods.
Down to the scheme. Everyone in UK would be allocated to annual carbon allowance.
So the electronic loyalty as the supermarket loyalty card, points will be deducted every time we buy or use non-renewable energy.
For example, using electricity to power appliances in the home, or traveling somewhere by plane,or even buying petro-fuel for the car.
The best way you can help is by rationing yourselves, I'm sure that all of you will buy your fair share and no more.
Airports were expanding all over the world, to cope with the exploding number of cheap flights we were all demanding.

Pierce is polishing his speech for tonight showdown with the local planning committee.
This committee can approve this application.
If you do, you would show courage and leadership.
He has just six minutes to convince them to approve his wind farm.
I'm absolutely confident that if you approve this project, you'll look back on the decision and say "Thank goodness we said yes. "
But the committee rejected pierce's application, saying that his wind farm would be conspicuous and out of place in the Bedfordshire landscape, that it would decrease enjoyment of nearby foot paths and negatively impact the listed buildings and the nation's monuments.
In other words, it would spoil the view.
Oh we're delighted that it's been refused.
It's a wonderful result.
It just shows if you work hard if you look at all the facts, if you do with fair and balance,you can get a good outcome.
10 against, one in favor,might even be 11 against one in favor.
But there only one guy who actually votes in favor.
Hi, mom. It's Piers. I think it's 10 to one or 11 to one against.
I could have said, be honest.It wouldn't make any difference.
Of course we're worried about global warming, I mean, it's got to be something we all concerned about.

Is the answer because on some level,we weren't sure if we were worth saving?

The age of stupid.
I just find it, surprising.
That after so much effort, the final act of our existence, should be suicide.
So why did I build this archive?
It's a cautionary tale.
Not for us. Too late for us.
For whoever, whatever,eventually finds this recording.
2,200 years ago, the first emperor, Qin Shi Huangdi, conquered all six Chinese kingdoms for the first time in history to create China.
To protect his empire, he built the first Great Wall and gave orders for the most spectacular tomb the world has ever seen to be constructed for his afterlife.
But after his death, the Qin dynasty would collapse in chaos and civil war, and the site of his epic tomb disappeared from history.
I remember it was hot season at that time.
Some farmers found something unknown while digging a well.
So they asked me to go to Xi'an to take a look.
How are things progressing? Don't miss anything.
When I first saw it, I felt so excited.
And it was just the tip of the iceberg.
A vast pottery army, slowly being unearthed from the tomb where it's lain for more than 2,000 years.
It is amazing, the tomb that is 19 square miles, and inside, there's thousands of pieces of these terracotta warriors.
The figures, each different, and numbering around 8,000, uncovered on the burial site of the country's first emperor.
They called it the Eighth Wonder of the World.
I remember, when I went to the excavation site as a kid, looking face to face at the 8,000 warriors.
All with distinct features.
That itself is already awe-inspiring.
Eight thousand warriors buried next to the man who created China.
That has to be the most important archaeological discovery of all time.
But the truly amazing thing is that the 8,000 warriors is guarding something much more important.
The first emperor's mausoleum.
This is a personal burial complex.
Sixty square kilometers, which is the equivalent to the size of Manhattan.
It is astonishing to think that this is all built for one man.
After the first emperor of Qin died, he was buried in a tomb beneath the huge mound at the heart of the site.
Since the surprise discovery of the warriors 50 years ago, archaeologists have unearthed countless discoveries.
But the enormity of the site means that they're not even close to uncovering it all.
The emperor's mausoleum was a replica of the Qin capital city with two huge walls around the mound and buildings covering tens of millions of square meters.
There are so many things buried underground.
Everything we find is so brilliant, and so vivid.
The discovery is unique.
We have terracotta servants who could serve him.
We have terracotta acrobats that could entertain him.
Terracotta chariots, horses.
What it all adds up to is a world of terracotta built for the emperor for him to rule over for eternity.
But how could a dynasty capable of creating something so extraordinary fall so quickly?
For archaeologists, the first clue is the condition in which the treasures were found.
I think people feel like, when we excavated, all these terracotta warriors were standing there.
But it was not the case.
All these terracotta warriors were broken into pieces.
No one survived.
Janice is part of a new army of archaeologists, forensic scientists, and restorers at what has become one of the largest archaeological sites in the world.
They are united in trying to discover exactly what happened to the warriors.
The hand's exposed.
The head should be here.
But be careful when you work on this part.
The surface has a lot of folds so we may be able to preserve some color.
That's the fascinating part, because you can tell they really have different personalities.
This is good.
So every face, you meet a new person from the Qin dynasty.
He's smiling.
In the restoration unit, the emperor's army is being pieced together one life-sized warrior at a time.
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
We have 36 big pieces.
And if we include bits of armor and the nails for it, that's nearly 400 pieces for one warrior.
That's a lot of pieces.
I often think I'm a relic doctor, accompanying them and treating them until they come back to life.
Generally speaking, this warrior is relatively complete.
Only his footboard is missing.
When it comes out, we can start to restore him.
The ultimate goal is to stand him up and get him back to his army.
A single statue can take up to three years to put back together.
We know the warriors were intact when they were buried.
But sometime between then and now, every single one of them was smashed.
That's one of the biggest mysteries that points us to why the Qin dynasty fell.
So, what happened?
In the pits where the warriors were buried, the archaeologists are trying to find out by forensically examining every piece of evidence.
There are a lot of theories.
Tomb robbers, vandalism, natural collapse.
But no one knows for certain.
What we know for sure is something big happened.
When you go deep into the work, sometimes you forget everything.
Our eyes are searching, trying to distinguish the differences with others we've seen before.
The soil looks wet. It's colored.
That's red fired earth.
- Fired earth? - Yes.
And wood charcoal.
It's been burnt.
Only when the fires were very strong and burned for a very long time would the soil turn red.
The broken pieces were the result of a collapse.
But this was man-made destruction.
The terracotta warriors were burned in a fire.
Who set the fire?
That is the question.
This is more than just an ancient wonder of the world.
It is also, in a sense, a giant crime scene.
Until the discovery of the tomb and the warriors, almost everything known about the Qin dynasty was taken from one historical record.
A revered 2,000-year-old text known as the Shiji.
Shiji is the first major history of China.
The main author is Sima Qian.
It contains a detailed account of the first emperor's life and his death.
In the 26th year of his rule, the first emperor unified all under heaven.
The Shiji tells the story of the first emperor, a warrior of Qin.
The emperor conquered six kingdoms and unified China for the first time in history under his total control.
He gave China its name.
But the record says that the mighty dynasty, destined for 10,000 generations, lasted for only 15 years before it collapsed.
One of the things that is special about the Shiji is the way it is written.
It combines history and epic drama.
Some of it, we are a little bit more skeptical if it happened or not.
We have no other finding that could back some of the claims up.
But the big question is how much of that is true?
So that's why the excavation is so exciting.
For the first time in 2,000 years, we have a chance to figure out whether what Sima Qian wrote is correct.
Let's measure the length and the width.
On the east side of the site, archaeologists have uncovered foundations of a monumental gate that they believe was once the main entrance to the mausoleum.
The width is 95.
- Ninety-five? - Yes.
And the hole?
This is the widest gate ever found in China.
After he proclaimed himself emperor, the site was constantly extended.
It was a national project.
They were gathering the whole empire to focus on one thing.
Work on the first emperor's tomb began when he was just 13 years old.
Be careful.
Careful.
Lift it up.
By the time he had conquered all of China, he commanded the vast resources required to build the greatest tomb complex on Earth.
In the storage vaults, Janice is examining evidence of the brutality meted out on those forced to build the tomb.
From the material remains, we can tell how hard that time was for people who worked here to construct this mausoleum complex.
You can see this is relatively big.
Not like on the legs. So that's really on someone's neck.
When the first emperor unified the empire, more than 700,000 convicts were sent to build his mausoleum at Mount Li.
The first emperor mobilized people by force.
Keep up.
He convicted as many people as possible.
Move quickly!
And made them part of the labor force that would work for his projects.
The Qin legal code is very detailed, and also very harsh.
Whenever you are associated with a criminal, you'll also get convicted.
If you were unlucky enough to have that happen to you, what awaits you is extremely brutal.
We find many of these kind of iron shackles within the mausoleum complex.
In Shiji, Sima Qian mentions a large quantity of convicts coming here, and also some other status people or craftspeople.
But particularly for these, we can see that many convicts were involved, and many people suffered.
What are you looking at? Move!
Have you tied it well?
Workshops in nearby towns were formed into a massive terracotta production line involving craftsmen drawn from across the empire.
The eyebrow can be slightly higher.
The eye is the key part.
This is the first time craftsmen from all seven Chinese states came together to work on one single project.
And the result of that was the creation of something that no one had ever seen before.
Pay attention to the area above the mouth.
For a civilization to produce something in such great detail on such scale over 2,200 years ago, it shows us a remarkable level of sophistication.
I've worked in restoration for 25 years.
And it's rare to see one warrior still completely colored.
This is the head of a warrior which we've recently excavated.
It belongs to a senior army officer.
When the warriors were first made, they were all colored.
But because they've been buried for over 2,000 years, and because of the movement of the soil, the colors on their surface usually fall off when they're excavated.
But this piece was buried in the very bottom, so it was better preserved.
When I look into their eyes and their facial expressions, it's like they're alive.
They're an incarnation of the Qin people, as well as an epitome of the Qin army.
I think these realistic faces were based on real people from all over China at the time.
And the idea probably came from the emperor himself.
Because it's a very, very powerful graphic representation of that feat he had achieved.
A fantastic symbol of the unification of different ethnic people.
Of this first unified empire.
If we did not have the first emperor, it is possible that China would have continued to be divided among different states, much like the divided Europe today.
So if we look at the warriors, I think it's really, really important in the context of world history, of global history, because you can see how China has become different, if not unique.
The emperor spared no expense and stopped at nothing in preparing for his afterlife.
But he had failed to prepare for his succession on Earth, refusing to announce an heir to his kingdom.
The danger of having too much power in the hands of one man was about to turn all he built, the whole Qin world, upside down.
The Shiji tells us the first emperor fell ill on tour through the eastern parts of the empire.
In the seventh month, the first emperor reached Shaqiu.
None would dare to mention the matter of death.
The story recorded in the Shiji says that traveling with the emperor on his fateful last tour were three characters who would play a key role in the future of the Qin dynasty.
Li Si was the emperor's right-hand man. He was the chief minister.
Nothing in the empire happened that did not go through him.
Quick.
Zhao Gao, a man from a disgraced family, had worked his way up to become the emperor's closest servant.
You!
Go find Si Li!
You!
Go find Hu Hai!
Crucially, Zhao Gao was the guardian of the imperial seal, which the emperor required to issue all of his commands.
And finally, there was the youngest of the emperor's sons, Prince Hu Hai.
Given that he was the youngest, Hu Hai was probably not very high up in the line of succession.
But he was the only son that accompanied the emperor on the tour.
Teacher.
The emperor is dead.
All he has left is this letter for his eldest son, designating him as heir.
If this letter is delivered, he will be enthroned as emperor.
And you will be left with nothing.
What should be done with it?
That should be obvious!
If our father has left orders, then what can we, as loyal subjects, presume to do?
Bid the chief minister to destroy this letter and support your own worthy claim.
I will not hear this.
At the moment, the decision of who shall take control of the empire lies with you, me, and the chief minister alone.
How can I consult the chief minister on such a matter?
Let me consult with him on your behalf.
After convincing the prince, Zhao Gao successfully persuaded the chief minister to join the conspiracy.
Together, they destroyed the letter from the emperor which named Hu Hai's eldest brother as the emperor's successor, and replaced it with a fake letter that told the rightful heir he had displeased his father and his immediate suicide was the only way to make amends.
The deed is done.
We can only resign ourselves to fate.
Come now.
In order for their plot to work, the conspirators had to keep the emperor's death a secret while they waited for their letter to take effect.
Stop.
Quick! Hurry up!
So the dead body of the most powerful man on the planet was bundled into his traveling carriage.
His corpse would be driven around in the sweltering Chinese summer heat until the rightful heir was fooled by the plotters.
Go!
As time passed, the body of the dead emperor became a liability.
The plotters reached for desperate measures.
The emperor's carriage began to stink in the hot weather.
To disguise the smell, the conspirators surrounded it with carts of fish.
Against the odds, the letter worked.
The rightful heir took his own life, and the plotters were free to return to the capital to announce the emperor's death, taking with them another forged letter naming Hu Hai as heir.
Hu Hai was installed as the second emperor.
But the conspirators feared the empire would not easily submit.
We know from records that when the emperor's death was finally announced that they would all have been together at the same event.
In the ninth month, the first emperor was buried at Mount Li.
Everyone within the Four Seas offered tribute.
The emperor's funeral should have been the crowning moment for the vast tomb complex he'd spent his adult life building.
But the conspiracy cast the event in a different light.
Front and center was the second emperor, Hu Hai, asserting his right to rule backed up by the two conspirators who had put him there.
Hu Hai's eldest brothers must have known that the succession had been fixed.
His sudden promotion over them was not just a personal slight.
Now they were potential threats to the throne.
Threats that could not be allowed to live.
Evidence of the horror that unfolded after the funeral has been uncovered at the site.
In the northeast corner of the inner city of the mausoleum, there are around 100 small tombs.
We excavated ten of them.
One of the tombs was wrecked.
But in the other nine, we found human bones.
The bones were so mixed up that we couldn't tell one body from another.
They seemed to have been dismembered.
We also found pearls in the soil.
It was a very unexpected find.
Some pearls had traces of being gilded.
It was a high-level luxury accessory, beyond the reach of common people.
Based on this discovery, we think they may be the first emperor's concubines.
The first to feel the wrath of the new regime were the unfortunate young women of the imperial harem.
The reason why they were targeted is not so clear from historical records.
But in the context of the conspiracy, we can find a possible logical explanation for it.
Some of the concubines may well have been on tour with the first emperor when he died and could have witnessed the strange events that surrounded the emperor's death.
Perhaps Hu Hai thought that these concubines knew too much.
There are many limb bones here.
These women are generally slender.
Also, they were not very tall.
They selected women with heights between 150 cm and 160 cm.
Their weight was also controlled within a range.
The Shiji says these women were ordered to die.
But there is no mention of how they died.
During the burial of the first emperor, the second emperor gave an order.
Of the women in the harem of the former ruler, it would be unfitting that those who had no sons be sent elsewhere.
All were accordingly ordered to accompany the dead emperor, which resulted in the death of many women.
Do you think this hole is from a chopping injury?
Or something else?
It doesn't look like that. It's not neat.
They may have been killed and then dismembered after.
Or they may actually have been hacked to death.
If they used weapons made of bronze or iron, it would leave a clean cut.
This injury was definitely caused after death.
It had nothing to do with how she died.
If they were dismembered after death, it would have been at the joints, where it's easier to cut through, especially when someone does it for a living.
- It appears they were dismembered. - That's right.
But their bodies were in one piece when they died.
We still don't know how the concubines died, but these women did not die of natural causes.
And however they were killed it was very cruel.
The brutality meted out to the concubines was just the beginning.
Chilling evidence of the conspirators' next move was discovered in a remote far corner of the site by Yuan Zhongyi.
During our exploration, we've found a lot of burial pits.
The people in them seem to have been murdered and mutilated at young ages.
In Shangjiao village, we found 17 small tombs and excavated eight of them.
I think the youngest one was only 18 years old, and the oldest one was 30.
As for who killed them?
We don't know.
The bodies were identified by a personal seal found in the grave.
By tradition, these were buried with the remains of high-status individuals.
We think they were the graves of the sons and daughters of the first emperor.
After the funeral, the conspirators turned their attention to each of Hu Hai's potential rivals.
Prince Jianglu, I am placing you and your brothers under arrest.
On what charge?
Disloyalty to the throne?
This is an outrage!
I demand to see my brother.
His Majesty's orders to me were very clear.
"No loose ends."
The real terror had just begun.
The law was made severe, and the punishments harsh.
Corpses formed heaps in the marketplace.
I must see His Majesty.
Your Highness.
What news?
All your father's ministers have been purged.
They move fast.
The worst is to come.
Yesterday, at the market in Xianyang, 12 of your brothers were executed.
And your sisters they were torn to pieces.
You must flee, Your Highness. Take your family and leave.
Your Highness.
The problem for Prince Gao and for the whole royal family was that there was nowhere to run.
I have committed no crime.
Those who were spared the public execution were given only one way out.
I have committed no crime!
By the end of the first year of Hu Hai's reign, the records say that most of his brothers and sisters were dead.
One of the site's most significant finds ever might be the key to proving that this is not just legend, but fact.
To the west of the site, close to the emperor's tomb mound, a huge excavation is underway.
A series of vast tombs has been discovered.
Opening them has never been attempted before.
It would usually be forbidden.
But the threat of rainwater damage has led to an exceptional decision.
To excavate one of the tombs.
The opportunity to excavate this tomb is completely unprecedented.
So it's the only opportunity.
Every time I go down, I still feel amazed.
The tomb was so precisely built.
So deep, so large in scale!
Most ancient tombs have been robbed, so we didn't have much hope for the coffin chamber.
But it turned out it hadn't been robbed.
We were amazed!
The coffin is badly decayed, but the tomb owner is still in there.
And lots of weapons were unearthed, including armor, crossbows, and swords.
What makes this tomb so exciting is that this is a real warrior of the Qin dynasty.
We already found thousands of terracotta warriors, but we didn't have the opportunity to excavate a real Qin warrior.
And this is quite close to the first emperor's tomb mound.
So, who was he?
Whoever this person was, he was clearly very important and very close to the emperor.
If we can figure out his identity, it could be key for us to understand what happened after the emperor's death.
Janice has been brought in to examine the extraordinary artifacts found with the coffin to see if they can help reveal more about the tomb owner's identity.
This is a jade disc. There is a circle outside, and a frame.
There is a thin pattern as well.
- Its outer ring. - Yes. In the middle part.
It's a geometric pattern as a whole.
The jade piece was an ornament on a scabbard.
The burial materials in Tomb One is really fascinating.
Some of the objects, we never seen before, like a gold camel and dancing figure.
From this, we can judge that the tomb owner might have a royal status.
It is rather finely decorated.
These are quite exotic objects that is the first time found in the mausoleum complex.
The question is whether we can tell the date.
Take it out and have a look.
This is from the late Warring States period.
Yes.
They couldn't be cast as late as the Han Dynasty.
It must have been cast earlier.
All these coins we discovered we call Ban Liang.
These kind of coins, the size of the coins, and also the character, definitely Qin coins from the later Qin.
The coins are clear evidence that the tomb owner was amongst the wealthiest of Qin society, and they date the burial to the end of the Qin dynasty.
How many pieces have been unearthed?
- It's about 5,000 to 6,000. - Five thousand to 6,000 pieces?
It's unusual to find 6,000 coins in this tomb.
It's really a fortune.
Let's take a look at this crossbow.
It's smaller than the ones from the Terracotta Warriors Pit.
And it has a casing.
Crossbows with trigger casings were very rare at that time.
This type of the crossbow triggers,that's late Qin dynasty.
And that gives quite narrow time window of this tomb.
From probably after the emperor died to before the fall of the Qin dynasty.
So that's three, four years.
So who could be buried with the Qin first emperor in this time period?
And why?
Narrowing the date reduces the list of candidates who could be in the tomb.
If the mystery warrior was buried between the death of the emperor and the fall of the Qin, then there is only a short list of candidates it could be.
After the first emperor died, his sons all came to a bad end.
So I'm still more inclined to believe that this tomb belongs to a high-ranking nobleman or army chief.
If archaeologists find a personal seal inside the coffin, they can prove beyond doubt the tomb owner's identity.
But the condition of the coffin means that this could take years.
Originally, we wanted to investigate the coffin in place.
Be careful of that wood.
But there's a big temperature difference between winter and summer.
With pieces of gold, jade, and precious metals exposed to the elements, they need to act fast.
If we clean it on site, the drastic change in temperature and humidity might have a big impact on the excavated relics and remains.
So we want to pack it first and take it indoors for the investigation.
Look at the objects on the pillar there.
We need something to protect them.
The plan involves packaging up the coffin along with the tons of earth that surround it and lifting the whole thing into the lab in one piece.
The extreme weight makes extracting the coffin deeply risky.
Nothing like this has ever been attempted before.
The steel plates can be put in one by one.
We can operate from here or from the other side.
Both sides will work.
We need to lay tracks up the passage.
Then use a crane with a 50 to 100-ton capacity to pull it up.
The problem is it's uneven and bumpy here, so it'll be difficult to load.
This is a huge archaeological challenge.
I'm sure we will solve all these problems.
Near to the tomb mound, Fu Jian's investigation is closing in on what happened to the buildings that once stood here.
We think there was a tower. I want to know how it was destroyed.
That's what I care about most.
If the damage done to the warriors extends here, it would mean this was more than just a robbery.
It would point to a very different explanation.
We just found some broken tiles.
One of them has characters on it.
That seems to be "Shui."
It's "Zuo Shui."
I think Zuo Shui was a manufacturer in the Qin dynasty.
It could be part of the tower.
In Pit One and Pit Two of the Warriors, there is clear evidence of man-made damage.
But there is no direct evidence to prove it was all done at the same time.
The fires in the Warrior Pits could have been caused by ancient robbers.
But if fires burned here at the same time so close to the tomb, it's evidence of a plan of deliberate destruction.
When the first emperor died, the convicts were still there working, building the huge mound over the tomb.
But almost exactly a year after the first emperor's death, a major uprising broke out in the east part of the empire, which was going to have a major effect on the construction of the mausoleum.
By the time anyone dared to tell the emperor there was a problem, the situation had spiraled out of control.
A rebel army, reportedly 300,000 strong, was heading towards the capital.
Then call up forces from the nearby districts and kill them.
Your Majesty, the bandits are already close by and great in number.
There is no time to call up forces from the nearby districts.
Are you saying we are powerless to stop them?
Have you lost your tongues?
Your Majesty, there are many convict laborers at Mount Li.
Might I humbly suggest that they be pressed into Your Majesty's service and used for an attack.
Do so with all haste.
And do not disturb me in my pleasure until it's done.
By order of His Imperial Majesty, all men over the age of 15 must take up arms and fight.
Why should we fight? What business is this war of ours?
- Silence! - Hold on!
Any convicted man that fights for His Majesty will be issued a pardon.
Hu Hai's force of untrained convicts was a far cry from the feared, well-disciplined army with which his father had conquered China.
Let's check if there's an inscription.
Janice is examining real weapons found in the pits alongside the terracotta warriors.
When we see any objects from the mausoleum complex, they have a big story behind it.
You can see it right on this spot.
The inscription is clear.
Terracotta warriors were equipped with bronze weapons.
The lances or halberds for the infantry.
The crossbows for the archers.
And we can tell from different weapons and how they mix together, the flexible battle tactic they use.
You have all these archers, or crossbowmen, in front of the military formation.
And they released arrows to the enemy before they come very close.
And then the crossbowmen moved to the back.
The infantry will have close combat with the enemy.
So that's a special tactic in the Qin dynasty.
- Prepare the attack. - Prepare the attack!
- Put out the fires! Get in line! - Put out the fires!
Move it!
Send the horses to scatter them.
We'll cut them down as they flee.
Attack!
A convict army armed with digging tools would have been lambs to the slaughter.
But fighting for Qin gave them access to some of the finest weapons in the ancient world.
And commanders who knew only victory.
Hold your positions!
Hold your positions!
Qin weapons and tactics made the difference.
Against the odds, the convict army prevailed.
The rebels were stopped in their tracks.
Their leaders hunted down.
But a tide of rebellion had begun.
And work on the tomb was abandoned.
After the convicts left, there's no further mention of the emperor's tomb complex in this historical record.
No one knows what happened to it after that.
The giant mound built to protect the emperor's tomb appears to have done its job.
There is no evidence anyone has ever broken inside.
But for the rest of the emperor's mausoleum, it was a different story.
Telltale signs of deliberate destruction are being examined in the restoration unit.
Another Qin masterpiece, the larger-than-life statue of an acrobat, is being pieced back together.
The signs of violence are clear.
This is very interesting.
It has marks showing it has been cut and smashed.
When we excavated this pit, the whole site was found to be severely damaged.
A survey of the Acrobat's Pit where the statue was buried revealed a patch of red earth.
The fire that destroyed them was so intense that it melted a bronze cauldron at the bottom of the pit into a flat plate.
During our work, many pits were discovered due to the important clue of red, burnt soil, including the Pit of Bronze Birds and the Acrobat Pit.
If we put these burnings together, and consider it as a whole it can't have been done by a few dozen people.
It would have taken hundreds, or even thousands of people, to do this damage.
But who did it?
At the Warrior's Tomb, Jiang Wenxiao's plans for the extraction of the coffin have received the go-ahead.
Just over here.
But given how risky the move will be, the team want to take samples from some of the exposed bones first.
It's not easy to walk in this suit.
Be careful.
The samples may also help establish the warrior's age.
It's right here. Let's take this as a sample.
It's part of the skull.
The skull was not complete.
Only a small part was preserved.
We also found limb bones in poor condition.
This is the top of the femur.
Here is the hip bone.
Over there is shin bone.
So the head is here. The body is this side.
- The head is in the south. - That's right.
And the feet are pointing north.
Look at the top of the femur.
The bone was quite thick.
So it's more likely to be a male.
Let's take a sample of this.
We took a section of the femur.
We want to find out if the tomb owner was a family member of the first emperor or a high-ranking statesman who had no blood relationship.
If the mystery warrior was a high-ranking government official, then we have to look at the possibility of him being one of the conspirators.
After two years of bloodshed, Hu Hai's empire was crumbling.
And as it did, the conspirators turned on each other.
The chief minister was the first to die.
Sentenced to death by the emperor after being double-crossed by Zhao Gao.
The five punishments were prepared for Li Si.
And he was condemned to be cut in two at the waist.
And once the chief minister was out of the way, Zhao Gao set his sights on the emperor himself.
Your Majesty, I'm here to inform you that your time as emperor is at an end.
If I am no longer to be emperor, tell Zhao Gao all I ask is to be king of one county, and I won't stand in his way.
Zhao Gao will shortly install a new emperor.
We have no use for kings.
A marquis, then!
The hour for daydreams is long past.
I ask for nothing then, but to live quietly as a commoner.
I have my orders.
And Your Majesty knows very well there can be no loose ends.
If the record is correct, we can be sure that Emperor Hu Hai is not the occupant of the mystery tomb.
He was buried without ceremony in a commoner's grave.
All Zhao Gao's plotting, though, was about to come back to bite him.
He chose Hu Hai's replacement to be easy to control.
But the new emperor had his own ideas.
I put you on the throne. How dare you keep me waiting?
Who are you to disobey my orders?
Who?
Zhao Gao!
So the first thing he did Who are you?
There is no record of where he was buried.
Our preliminary evaluation suggests that it should be a male.
But we would like to do a DNA test to find out more about him.
We have to take very small parts of the bones and send them away to be tested.
We also found a tooth.
It was the owner's premolar.
You can see the development of the tooth, and it has no enamel defects.
It indicates that, during their life, they had sufficient nutrition.
There is no dentin exposure, so it should be a young person.
The age of this person must be between 18 and 22.
So he was a young man.
The evidence that the warrior died young rules out the conspirators.
They were too old.
Revealing the age makes it more likely that he may have been a prince.
And the detail in the Shiji concerning one prince in particular casts new light on everything found at the warrior's tomb.
In the early days of the conspiracy when Hu Hai was murdering his brothers and sisters, one of them, Prince Gao, made a bold decision.
You must flee, Your Highness.
Take your family and leave.
Prince Gao wished to flee.
But fearing his family would be arrested and exterminated, instead, he delivered a letter for the second emperor.
I should have followed the former emperor in death.
As a son, I have been disloyal.
As a subject, I have been disloyal.
And one who acts disloyally wins no fame in this world.
I ask leave to follow the former emperor in death.
My only request is to be buried in the mausoleum at the foot of Mount Li.
I can but hope that the emperor will take pity and grant my request.
I will pass on your request to the emperor and bid him give this matter his full attention at his earliest convenience.
Prince Gao offered to kill himself to save his family from suffering the same fate as his brothers and sisters.
I think what Prince Gao did was a heroic and brave act.
And that is probably why the story attracted special attention from Sima Qian and made its way into the Shiji.
Sima Qian also tells us that Hu Hai was delighted reading the letter from Prince Gao.
And not only did he agree to Prince Gao's request, but he also awarded him with 100,000 bronze coins for his burial.
If Shiji is correct, then we can assume that Prince Gao is buried somewhere around the mausoleum site.
But so far, his tomb has not been identified.
If we could prove that the mystery warrior was Prince Gao, that would be a mind-blowing discovery.
Given the tomb owner was young, it's certainly possible that it might be Prince Gao.
But we can't say that for sure based on this.
So we need to get it safely to the lab to complete our work.
We must get it done within an hour.
Pull.
The wheels are stuck.
The steel track is bent, but it's going to be okay.
Is it raining outside?
It's raining!
Get the plastic to cover it!
How do I feel? I feel very happy indeed.
We have completed such a big project.
We hope that we can find a seal or similar artifacts that can prove the identity of the tomb owner conclusively.
We have a lot of faith in it.
All these stories that are circulating for over 2,000 years, now that we have such findings it will prove that all these figures were true.
Like Zhao Gao, like Hu Hai, were real people, not characters in a legend, or just a story.
All of these figures will have existed in history.
Now, 50 years on from the discovery of the first terracotta warrior, conclusive evidence of systematic destruction has been found all over the site.
See the red soil?
I think this building was destroyed by a fire soon after it was built.
Across the whole Qin mausoleum, there are traces of burning.
We are not sure when the traces were left.
But what we can confirm is that the damage in the warrior pits happened early, before the wood there had decayed.
That's wood charcoal.
When we excavated the east gate, the situation was the same.
It's been burned.
Yes.
And on these buildings, we found the same traces of burning too.
So all this destruction seems to have happened at around the same time in the late Qin dynasty.
When the fall of Qin came, it came violently at the hands of a rebel general who led his army to the capital and beheaded Hu Hai's successor.
The rebel armies butchered the capital, and the fires burned for three months.
There is no written proof that the rebel army destroyed the first emperor's mausoleum.
But being close to the capital, it would have been a prime target.
In my opinion, the theft, destruction, and burning down of the mausoleum should be attributed to this rebel army.
They had the numbers and the power, and they had opportunity and time.
It's likely some of the soldiers had been convicts forced to work on the construction.
So they would have remembered where things were buried.
Hey, they're down here!
It was revenge.
When all under heaven had been settled, the house of Qin fell because they ruled without humanity or righteousness.
I think the Qins' cruel way of mobilizing and punishing the population led to the destruction of the mausoleum.
But the high level of artistic creativity did not grow from this cruelty.
It grew out of the fusion of different cultural elements from various parts of what we call China today.
The first emperor's vision of a unified China survived.
It survived the fall of the Qin dynasty.
And it is still very much alive today.
I think, in the end, the warriors were destroyed due to the harsh conditions that they were created in.
But they also show us what human beings were capable of doing 2,200 years ago.
To me, even after all this time, the warriors are a reminder of the magnificence of the human spirit.
And they still have the power to take our breath away.
This is his footboard.
My whole life has been dedicated to archaeology.
It's been 48 or 49 years now.
Making the warriors known to the world was a task that fell on our shoulders.
It was an honor for us.
The warriors are my dearest friends.
When they are loved by people all over the world, it makes me very happy.
It was difficult at times, but in the greatest hardship, we find the greatest joy.
Just as flowers watered by perspiration are the most beautiful the terracotta warriors gave us the greatest happiness.
A cofounder of the social, news and entertainment website Reddit has been found dead.
He certainly was a prodigy, although he never kind of thought of himself like that.
He was totally unexcited about starting businesses and making money.
There's a profound sense of lost in Highland Park, Aaron Swartz's hometown, as loved ones say good bye to one of the Internet's brightest lights.
Freedom, open access and computer activists are mourning his loss.
"An astonishing intellect", if you talk to people who knew him.
He was killed by the government and MIT betrayed all of its basic principles.
They wanted to make an example out of him.
Governments have insatiable desire to control.
He was potentially facing 35 years in prison and a one million dollar fine.
Raising questions of prosecutorial zeal, and I would say even misconduct.
Have you looked into that particular matter and reached any conclusions?
Growing up, you know, I slowly had this process of realizing that all the things around me, that people had told me were just the natural way things were, the way things always would be.
They weren't natural at all, there were things that could be changed and there were things that more importantly were wrong and should change.
And once I realized that, there was really kind of no going back.
Welcome to story reading time.
The name of the book is "Paddington at the fair".
Well, he was born in Highland Park and grew up here.
Aaron came from a family of three brothers, all extraordinarily bright.
Oh, the box is tipping over.
So we were all, you know, not the best behaved children.
You know, three boys running around all the time, causing trouble.
Hey, no, no no!
-Aaron! -What?
But I've come to the realization that Aaron learned how to learn at a very young age.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
- Knock, knock!
- Who's there?
- Aaron.
- Aaron who?
- Aaron Funnyman.
He knew what he wanted, and he always wanted to do it.
He always accomplished what he wanted.
His curiosity was endless.
Here's a little picture of what the planets are.
And each planet has a symbol.
Mercury symbol, Venus symbol, Earth symbol, Mars symbol.
One day he said to Susan:
what's this free family entertainment downtown Highland Park?
what's this free family entertainment downtown Highland Park?
He was three at the time.
And she said: what are you talking about?
He said: Look, it says here on the refrigerator, "Free family entertainment downtown Highland Park".
She was floored and astonished that he could read.
It's called "My Family Seder".
That Seder night is different from all other nights.
I remember once, we were at the University of Chicago Library.
I pulled a book off the shelf, that was from like 1900.
And showed him: you know, this is an extraordinary place.
We all were curious children, but Aaron really liked learning and really liked teaching.
And what we're going to learn is ABC backwards.
I remember he came home from his first Algebra class.
He was like: "Noah, let me teach you Algebra!"
I'm like: what is Algebra?
And he was always like that.
Now let's press click button, there! Now it's got that!
Now it's in pink!
When he was about two or three years old, and Bob introduced him to computers, then he just took off, like crazy on them.
We all had computers, but Aaron really took to them, really took to the Internet.
Working at the computer?
mommy, why is nothing working?
He started programming from a really young age.
I remember the first program that I wrote with him was in Basic, and it was a Star Wars trivia game.
He sat down with me in the basement, where the computer was, for hours, programming this game.
The problem that I kept having with him is that there was nothing that I wanted done.
And to him, there was always something to do, always something that programming could solve.
The way Aaron always saw it, is that programming is magic.
You can accomplish these things that normal humans can't.
Then we made an ATM, using like a MacIntosh and like a cardboard box.
One year for Halloween, I didn't know what I wanted to be, and he thought it would be really cool if I dressed up like his new favorite computer, which at the time was the original iMac.
I mean, he hated dressing up for Halloween but he loved convincing other people to dress up in these things that he wanted to see.
Host Aaron, stop!
Guys, come on, look at the camera!
He made this website called The Info, where people could just fill in the information I'm sure someone out there knows everything about gold, gold leafing.
Why they don't write about that on this website?
And then other people can come at a later point and read that information, and edit the information if they thought it was bad.
Not too dissimilar from Wikipedia, right?
And this was before Wikipedia begun, and this is developed by a 12 year old, in his room, by himself, running on this tiny server, using ancient technology.
One of the teachers response was, like:
"This is a terrible idea, you cant' just let anyone author the encyclopedia.
The whole reason we have scholars is to write these books for us.
How did you have such a terrible idea?
Me and my other brother will go, like:
"Oh, you know, Wikipedia is cool, but we had that in our house, like, five years ago".
Aaron's website, theinfo.org, wins a school competition hosted by the Cambridge-based web design firm Ars Digita.
We all went to Cambridge when he won the Ars Digita prize and we had no clue what Aaron was doing.
It was obvious that the prize was really important.
Aaron soon became involved with online programming communities, then in the process of shaping a new tool for the web.
He comes up saying to me like: Ben, there's this really awesome thing that I'm working on.
You need to hear about it!
And I'm like: yeah, what is it?
And he says: It's a thing called RSS.
And he explains me what RSS is.
And I'm like: why is that useful, Aaron?
Is any site using it, like why would I want to use it?
There is this mailing list for people who are working on RSS, and XML more generally.
And there's a person on it named Aaron Swartz, who is combative but very smart and who had lots of good ideas and he'd never come to the face to face meetings, and they said, you know, when are you gonna come to any of these face to face meetings?
And he said: you know, I don't think my mom would let me.
I've just turned 14.
So their first reaction was, you know, this person, this colleague we'we been working with all year is was 13 years old while we were working with him, and he's only 14 now.
And their second reaction was: Christ, we really want to meet him!
That's extraordinary!
He was part of the committee that drafted RSS.
What he was doing was to help build the plumming for modern hypertext.
The piece that he was working on, RSS, was a tool that you can use to get summaries of things that are going on on other web pages.
Most commonly, you would use this for a blog.
You might have 10 or 20 people's blogs you wanna read.
You use their RSS feeds, these summaries of what's going on on those other pages to create a unified list of all the stuff that's going on.
Aaron was very young, but he understood the technology and he saw that it was imperfect and looked for ways to help make it better.
So his mom started bundling him on planes in Chicago, we'd pick him up in San Francicso.
We'd introduce him to interesting people to argue with, and we'd marvle at his horriffic eating habits.
He only ate white food, only like steamed rice and not fried rice 'cause that wasn't sufficiently white and white bread, and so on.
And you kind of marvled at the quality of the debate emerging from this, what appeared to be a small boy's mouth.
And you'd think, this is a kid that's really going to get somewhere if he doesn't die of scurvy.
Aaron, you're up!
I think the difference is that now you can't make companies like dotcoms.
You can't have companies that just sell dog food over the Internet, or sell dog food over cell phones.
But there's still a lot of innovation going on.
Think that maybe if you don't see the innovation, maybe your head is in the sand!
He takes on this, like an alpha nerd personality, where he's sort of like:
"I'm smarter than you, and because I'm smarter than you.
I'm better than you, and I can tell you what to do".
It's an extension of, like, him being kind of like a twerp.
So you aggregate all these computers together and now they're solving big problems like searching for aliens and trying to cure cancer.
I first met him on IRC, or Internet Relay Chat.
He didn't just write code, he also got people excited about solving problems he got.
He was a connector.
The free culture movement, he had a lot of this energy.
I think Aaron was trying to make the world work.
He was trying to fix it.
He had a very kind of strong personality, that definitely ruffled feathers at times.
It wasn't necessarily the case that he was always comfortable in the world and the world wasn't always comfortable with him.
Aaron got into high school and he was really just sick of school.
He didn't like it, he didn't like any of the classes that were being thaught, he didn't like the teachers.
Aaron really knew how to get information.
He was like: "I don't need to go to this teacher to learn how to do geometry.
I can just read the geometry book.
And I don't need to go to this teacher to learn their version of American history, like I have like three historical compilations here, I could just read them.
And I'm not interested in that, I'm interested in the web".
I was very frustrated with school, I thought the teachers didn't know what they were talking about.
They were domineering and controlling, the homework was kind of a sham and it was all just like all about a way to pen students all together and force them to do busy work.
And, you know, I started reading books about the history of education and how this educational system was developed.
Then, you know, alternatives to it and ways that people could actually learn things as opposed to just regurgitating facts that teachers told them.
And that kind of led me down this path of questioning things, once I questioned the school I was in, I questioned the society that built the school, I questioned the businesses that the schools were training people for, I questioned the government that set up this whole structure.
One of the thing he was most passionate about was copyright, especially in those early days.
Copyright has always been something kind of a burden on the publishing industry and on readers, but it wasn't an eccessive burden, it was a reasonable institution to have in place, to make sure that people got paid.
What Aaron's generation experienced was the collision between this antique copyright system and this amazing new thing we were trying to build, the Internet and the Web.
These things collided, and what we got was chaos.
He then met Harvard's Law professor Lawrence Lessig, who was then challenging copyright law in the Supreme Court.
The young Aaron Swartz flew to Washington to listen to the Supreme Court hearings.
I am Aaron Swartz and I'm here to listen to the elder, to see the elder.
Why did you fly out here from Chicago and come all this way to see the elder that you met?
That's a more difficult question.
I don't know.
It's very exciting to see the Supreme Court, especially in such a prestigious case as this one.
Lessig was also moving forward with a new way to define copyright on the Internet.
It was called Creative Commons.
So the simple idea of Creative Commons is to give people, creators, a simple way to mark their creativity with the freedoms they intended to carry.
So if copyright is all about "All rights reserved", then this is a kind of a "Some rights reserved" model.
I wanted a simple way to say to you: here is what you can do with my work, even if there are other things which you need to get my permission before you could do.
And Aaron's role was the computer part.
Like how do you architect the licenses, so they'll be simple and understandable and expressed in a way so that machines can process it.
And people were like: why do you have this 15 years old kid writing the specifications for Creative Commons?
Don't you think that's a huge mistake?
And Larry's like: the biggest mistake we would have is not listening to this kid.
He barely is not even tall enough to even get over the podium.
And it wasn't this movable podium so it was this embarrassing thing, where once he put his screen up nobody could see his face.
When you come to our website here, and you go to "Choose license", you get to this list of options, it explains what it means, and you've three simple questions:
Do you want to require attribution?
Do you want to allow commercial uses of your work?
Do you want to allow modifications of your work?
I was floored, just completely flabbergasted that these adults regarded him as an adult.
And Aaron stood up there in fromt of a whole audience full of people and just started talking about the platform that he'd created for Creative Commons.
And they were all listening to him. Just I was sitting at the back, thinking:
You're just a kid, why are they listening to you?
But they did.
Well, I don't think I comprehended it fully.
Though critics have said it does little to ensure artists get paid for their work, the success of Creative Commons has been enormous.
Currently on the website Flickr alone, over 200 million people use some form of Creative Commons license.
He contributed through his technical abilities, and yet it was not simply a technical matter to him.
Aaron often wrote candidly in his personal blog:
I think deeply about things, and I want others to do likewise.
I work for ideas and learn from people. I don't like excluding people.
I'm a perfectionist, but I won't let that get in the way of publication.
Except for education and entertainment, I'm not going to waste my time on things that won't have an impact.
I try to be friends with everyone, but I hate it when you don't take me seriously.
I don't hold grudges, it's not productive, but I learn from my experience.
I want to make the world a better place.
In 2004, Swartz leaves Highland Park and enrolls in Stanford University.
He'd had ulcerative colitis which was very troubling and we were concerned about him taking his medication.
He got hospitalized and he would take this cocktail of pills every day.
And one of those pills was a steroid which stunted his growth, and made him feel different from any of the other students.
Aaron, I think, shows up at Stanford ready to do scholarship and finds himself in effectively a babysitting program for overachieving high-schoolers.
Who in four years are meant to become captains of industry and one-percenters and I think it just made him bananas.
In 2005, after only one year of college, Schwartz was offered a spot at a new start-up incubation firm called Y Combinator, lead by Paul Graham.
He's like, "Hey, I have this idea for a website".
And Paul Graham likes him enough, and says, "Yeah, sure".
Suddenly he drops out of school, moves to this apartment.
So this used to be Aaron's apartment when he moved here.
I have vague memories of my father telling me how difficult it was to get a lease, because Aaron had no credit and he dropped out of college.
Aaron lived in what's now the living room and some of the posters are leftovers from when Aaron lived here.
And the library there are more books, but a lot of them are Aaron's.
Aaron's Y Combinator site was called infogami, a tool to build websites.
But infogami struggles to find users, and Swartz eventually merges his company with another Y Combinator project in need of help.
It was a project headed by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, called reddit.
That we were, starting from almost nothing.
No users, no money, no code, and growing day by day into a hugely popular website.
And it showed no signs of letting up, first we had 1000 users, then 10000, then 20000 and on, and on.
It was just incredible.
Reddit becomes huge and it's a real sort of geeky corner of the Internet.
There's a lot of humor, there's a lot of arts, and there's just people who flocked to the site and made that site the main site they go to every morning to get their news.
Reddit kind of just borders on chaos at some levels, so on the one hand it's a place where people discuss news of the day, technology, politics and issues.
And yet there is a lot of kind of Not Safe For Work material, offensive material.
There are some sub-reddits where trolls find a welcome home and so, in that sense reddit has been kind of home to controversy, as well.
It kind of sits on that edge of chaos.
Reddit catches the attention of the corporate magazine giant Condé Nast, who makes an offer to buy the company.
Some large amount of money, large enough that my dad was getting bugged with questions about like:
"How do I store this money?"
Like a lot of money.
- Like a lot of money.
Like probably more than a million dollars, but I don't actually know.
And he's how old at the time?
19  20 So it was in this apartment, they sat around on what predated these couches hacking on Reddit, and when they sold Reddit they threw a giant party, and then all flew out to California the next day and left the keys with me.
It was funny, you know, he'd just sold his start up so we all presumed he was the richest person around.
But he said, "Oh no, I'll take this tiny little shoe-box sized room. That's all I need".
It was barely larger than a closet.
The idea of him spending his money on fancy objects just seemed so implausible.
He explains it as I like living in apartments so I'm not going to spend a lot of money on a new place to live, I'm not gonna buy a mansion.
And I like wearing jeans and a T-shirt, so I'm not going to spend any more money on clothes.
So it's really no big deal.
What is a big deal to Swartz is how traffic flows on the internet.
And what commands our attention.
In the old system of broadcasting, you're fundamentally limited by the amount of space in the airwaves.
You can only send out ten channels over the airwaves, television or even with cable, you had 500 channels.
On the Internet, everybody can have a channel.
Everyone can get a blog, or a Myspace page.
Everyone has a way of expressing themselves.
What you see now is not a question of who gets access to the airwaves, it's a question of who gets control over the ways you find people.
You know, you start seeing power centralizing in sites like Google, they are sort of gate-keepers that tell you where on the internet you want to go.
The people who provide you your sources of news and information.
So it's not only certain people have a license to speak, now everyone has a license to speak. It's a question of who gets heard.
After he started working in San Francisco at Condé Nast, he comes into the office and they want to give him a computer with all this crap installed on it.
And say he can't install any new things on his computer, which to developers is outrageous.
From the first day he was complaining about all the stuff.
Gray walls, gray desks, gray noise.
The first day I showed up here, I simply couldn't take it.
By lunchtime, I had literally locked myself in a bathroom stall and started crying.
I can't imagine staying sane with someone buzzing in my ear all day Let alone getting any actual work done.
Nobody else seems to get work done here either.
Everybody's always coming into our room to hang out and chat, or invite us to play the new video game system that Wired is testing.
He really had different aspirations that were politically oriented.
And Silicon Valley just doesn't really quite have that culture that orients technical activity for the purposes of political goals.
Aaron hated working for a corporation.
They all hate working for Condé Nast, but Aaron is the only one who is not going to take it.
And Aaron basically gets himself fired.
By not showing up to work, ever.
It was said to be a messy break-up.
Both Alexis Ohanian and Steve Huffman declined to be interviewed for this film.
He rejected the business world.
One of the really important things to remember about that choice when Aaron decided to leave start-up culture is that he was also leaving behind the things that had made him famous and well-loved. He was at risk of letting down fans.
He got to where he was supposed to be going, and had the self-awareness and the orneriness to realize that he had climbed the mountain of shit to pluck the single rose and discovered that he'd lost his sense of smell.
And rather than sit there and insist that it wasn't as bad as it seemed, and he did get the rose in any event, he climbed back down again, which is pretty cool.
The way Aaron always thought it is that programming is magic.
You can accomplish these things that normal humans can't, by being able to program.
So if you had magical powers, would you use them for good, or to make you mountains of cash?
Swartz was inspired by one of the visionaries he had met as a child.
The man who had invented the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee.
In the 1990s, Berners-Lee was arguably sitting on one of the most lucrative inventions of the 20th century.
But instead of profiting from the invention of the World Wide Web, he gave it away for free.
It is the only reason the World Wide Web exists today.
Aaron is certainly deeply influenced by Tim.
Tim is certainly a very prominent early Internet genius, who doesn't in any sense cash out.
He's not at all interested in how he's going to figure out how to make a billion dollars.
People were saying, "Ah there's money to be made there", so there would have been lots of little webs.
Instead of one big one.
And one little web, all sorts of webs doesn't work, because you can't follow links from one to the other.
You had to have the critical masses, the thing was the entire planet, so it's not going to work unless the whole planet can get on board.
I feel very strongly that it's not enough to just live in the world as it is, it's just kind of take what you're given, and you know follow the things that adults told you to do, and that your parents told you to do, and that society tells you to do.
I think you should always be questioning.
I take this very scientific attitude, that everything you've learned is just provisional, you know, it's always open to recantation or refutation or questioning, and I think the same applies to society.
Once I realized that there were real serious problems, fundamental problems that I could do something to address, I didn't see a way to forget that, I didn't see a way not to.
We just started spending a lot of time, just kind of as friends.
We would just talk for hours, into the night.
I definitely should have understood that he was flirting with me.
I think to some degree I was like, this is a terrible idea, and impossible, and therefore I will pretend it is not happening.
As my marriage was breaking down and I was really stuck without anywhere to go, we became roommates, and I brought my daughter over.
We moved in and furnished the house, and it was really peaceful.
My life had not been peaceful for a while, and really neither had his.
We were extremely close from the beginning of our romantic relationship.
We just...we were in constant contact.
But we're both really difficult people to deal with.
In a very Ally McBeal discussion he confessed he had a theme song, and I made him play it for me.
It was Extraordinary Machine, by Fiona Apple.
I think it was just that sense of being a little bit embattled that the song has.
And it also had this hopefulness to it.
In many ways, Aaron was tremendously optimistic about life.
Even when he didn't feel it, he could be tremendously optimistic about life.
What are you doing?
Flicker has video now.
Swartz threw his energy into a string of new projects involving access to public information.
Including an accountability webside called Watchdog.net and a project called The Open Library.
So the Open Library Project is a website you can visit at openlibrary.org and the idea is to be a huge wiki, an editable website with one page per book.
So for every book ever published, we want to have a web page about it that combines all the information from publishers, from booksellers, from libraries, from readers onto one site. And then gives you links where you can buy it, you can borrow it, or you can browse it.
I love libraries. I'm the kind of person who goes to a new city and immediately seeks out the library.
That's the dream of Open Library, is building this website where both you can leap from book to book, from person to author, from subject to idea.
Go through this vast tree of knowledge that's been embedded and lost in big physical libraries, that's hard to find, that's not very well accessible online.
It's really important because books are our cultural legacy.
Books are the place people go to write things down, and to have all that swallowed up by one corporation is kind of scary.
How can you bring public access to the public domain?
It may sound obvious that you'd have public access to the public domain, but in fact it's not true.
So the public domain should be free to all, but it's often locked up.
There's often guard cages. It's like having a national park but with a moat around it, and gun turrets pointed out, in case somebody may want to actually come and enjoy the public domain.
One of the things Aaron was particularly interested in was bringing public access to the public domain.
This is one of the things that got him into so much trouble.
I had been trying to get access to federal court records in the United States.
What I discovered was a puzzling system, called Pacer.
Which stands for Public Access to Court Electronic Records.
I started Googling, and that's when I ran across Carl Malamud.
Access to legal materials in the U.S. is a $10 billion per year business.
Pacer is just this incredible abomination of government services.
It's 10 cents a page, it's this most brain dead code you've ever seen.
You can't search it, you can't bookmark anything.
You've got to have a credit card, and these are public records.
U.S. district courts are very important, it's where a lot of our seminal litigation starts.
Civil rights cases, patent cases, all sorts of stuff.
Journalists, students, citizens and lawyers all need access to Pacer and it fights them every step of the way.
People without means can't see the law as readily as people that have that gold American Express card.
It's a poll tax on access to justice.
You know the law is the operating system of our democracy and you have to pay to see it?
You know, that's not much of a democracy.
They make about 120 million dollars a year on the Pacer system and it doesn't cost anything near that, according to their own records.
In fact, it's illegal.
The E-government Act of 2002 states that the courts may charge only to the extent necessary, in order to reimburse the costs of running Pacer.
As the founder of Public.Resource.Org, Malamud wanted to protest the PACER charges.
He started a program called The PACER Recycling Project, where people could upload PACER documents they had already paid for to a free database so others could use them.
The PACER people were getting a lot of flack from Congress and others about public access, and so they put together a system in 17 libraries across the country that was free PACER access.
You know, that's one library every 22,000 square miles, I believe, so it wasn't like really convenient.
I encouraged volunteers to join the so-called Thumb Drive Corps, and download docs from the public access libraries, upload them to the PACER recycling site.
People take a thumb drive into one of these libraries, and they download a bunch of documents, and they send them to me.
I mean, it was just a joke.
In fact, when you clicked on Thumb Drive Corps, there was a Wizard of Oz, you know, the Munchkins singing, so a videoclip came up:
We represent the lollipop guild... but of course, I get this phone calls from Steve Schultz and Aaron, saying, "Gee, we'd like to join the Thumb Drive Corps".
Around that time, I ran into Aaron at a conference.
This is something that really has to be a collaboration between a lot of different people.
So I approached him and I said, "Hey, I am thinking about an intervention on the PACER problem".
Schultz had already developed a program that could automatically download PACER documents from the trial libraries.
Swartz wanted to take a look.
So, I showed him the code, and I didn't know what would come next, but as it turns out, over the course of the next few hours at that conference, he was off sitting in a corner, improving my code, recruiting a friend of his that lived near one of these libraries to go into the library.
And to begin to test his improved code, at which point the folks at the courts realized something is not going quite according to plan.
And data started to come in, and come in, and come in and soon there was 760 GB of PACER docs, about 20 million pages.
Using information retrieved from the trial libraries, Swartz was conducting massive automated parallel downloading of the PACER system.
He was able to acquire nearly 2.7 million Federal Court documents, almost 20 million pages of text.
Now, I'll grant you that 20 million pages had perhaps exceed the expectations of the people running the pilot access project, but surprising a bureaucrat isn't illegal.
Aaron and Carl decided to go talk to The New York Times about what happened.
They also caught the attention of the FBI, who began to stake out Swartz's parents' house in Illinois.
And I get a tweet from his mother, saying, "Call me"!
So, I think, like, what the hell's going on here?
And so, finally I get a hold of Aaron and, you know, Aaron's mother was like, "Oh my God, FBI, FBI, FBI"!
An FBI agent drives down our home's driveway, trying to see if Aaron is in his room.
I remember being home that day, and wondering why this car was driving down our driveway, and just driving back up.
That's weird!
Like, five years later I read this FBI file, like, oh my goodness:
that was the FBI agent, in my driveway.
He was terrified.
He was totally terrified.
He was way more terrified after the FBI actually called him up on the phone, and tried to sucker him into coming down to a coffee shop without a lawyer.
He said he went home and lay down on the bed and, you know, was shaking.
The downloading also uncovered massive privacy violations in the court documents.
Ultimately, the courts were forced to change their policies as a result, and the FBI closed their investigation without bringing charges.
To this day, I find it remarkable that anybody, even at the most remote podunk field office of the FBI thought that a fitting use for taxpayer dollars was investigating people for criminal theft on the grounds that they had made the law public.
How can you call yourself a lawman, and think that there could possibly be anything wrong in this whole world with making the law public?
Aaron was willing to put himself at risk for the causes that he believed in.
Bothered by wealth disparity, Swartz moves beyond technology, and into a broader range of political causes.
I went into Congress, and I invited him to come and hang out and intern for us for a while so that he could learn the political process.
He was sort of learning about new community and new sets of skills and kind of learning to hack politics.
It seems ridiculous that miners should have to hammer away until their whole bodies are dripping with sweat faced with the knowledge that if they dare to stop, they won't able to put food on the table that night, while I get to make larger and larger amounts of money each day just by sitting and watching TV.
But apparently the world is ridiculous.
So, I co-founded a group called "The Progressive Change Campaign Committee", and what we try and do is we try to organize people over the Internet who care about progressive politics and moving the country toward a more progressive direction to kind of come together, join our e-mail list, join our campaigns.
And help us to get progressive candidates elected all across the country.
The group is responsible for igniting the grassroots effort behind the campaign to elect Elizabeth Warren to the Senate.
He might have thought it was a dumb system but he came in and he said, "I need to learn this system, because it can be manipulated like any social system".
But his passion for knowledge and libraries didn't take a back seat.
Aaron began to take a closer look at institutions that publish academic journal articles.
By virtue of being students at a major U.S. university, I assume you have access to a wide variety of scholarly journals.
Pretty much every major university in the United States pays these sort of licensing fees to organizations like JSTOR and Thompson ISI to get access to scholarly journals that the rest of the world can't read.
These scholarly journals and articles are essentially the entire wealth of human knowledge online, and many have been paid for with taxpayer money or with government grants, but to read them, you often have to pay again handing over steep fees to publishers like Reed-Elsevier.
These licenses fees are so substantial that people who are studying in India, instead of studying in United States, don't have this kind of access.
They are locked out from all of these journals.
They are locked out from our entire scientific legacy.
I mean, a lot of these journal articles, they go back to The Enlightenment.
Every time someone has written down a scientific paper, it's been scanned, digitized, and put in these collections.
That is a legacy that has been brought to us by the history of people doing interesting work, the history of scientists.
It's a legacy that should belong to us as a commons, as a people, but instead, it has been locked up and put online by an handful of for-profit corporations who then try to get the maximum profit they can out of it.
So a researcher paid by the university or the people publishes a paper, and at the very, very last step of that process, after all the work is done, after all the original research is done the thinking, the lab work, the analysis, after everything is done, at that last stage, then the researcher has to hand over his or her copyright to this multi-billion dollar company.
And it's sick.
It's an entire economy built on volunteer labor, and then the publishers sit at the very top and scrape off the cream.
Talk about a scam.
One publisher in Britain made a profit of three billion dollars last year.
I mean, what a racket!
JSTOR is just a very, very small player in that story but for some reason, JSTOR is the player that Aaron decided to confront.
He'd gone to some conference around Open Access and Open Publishing, and I don't know who the person from JSTOR was, but I think they at some point, Aaron asked the question, "How much would it cost to open up JSTOR in perpetuity?"
And they gave some I think it was two hundred million dollars, something that Aaron thought was totally ridiculous.
Working on a fellowship at Harvard, he knew users on MIT's famously open and fast network next door had authorized access to the riches of JSTOR.
Swartz saw an opportunity.
You have a key to those gates, and with a little bit of shell script magic, you can get those journal articles.
On September 24, 2010, Swartz registered a newly purchased Acer laptop on the MIT network, under the name "Garry Host".
The client name was registered as "GHost laptop".
He doesn't hack JSTOR in the traditional sense of hacking.
The JSTOR database was organized, so it was completely trivial to figure out how you could download all the articles in JSTOR, because it was basically numbered.
It was basically slash slash slash number article 444024 and -25 and -26.
He wrote a Python script called keepgrabbing.pi, which was like, keeping grabbing one article after another.
The next day, GHost laptop begins grabbing articles, but soon, the computer's IP address is blocked.
For Swartz, it'a barely a bump in the road.
He quickly reassigns his computer's IP address and keeps downloading.
Well, JSTOR and MIT take a number of steps to try to interfere with this, when they notice that this is happening, and when the more modest steps don't work, then at a certain stage, JSTOR just cuts off MIT from having access to the JSTOR database.
So there's a kind of cat-and-mouse game around getting access to the JSTOR database.
Aaron, ultimately, obviously is the cat because he has more technical capability than the JSTOR database people do in defending them.
Eventually, there was an unlocked supply closet in the basement of one of the buildings, and he went, instead of going through WiFi, he went down there and he just plugged his computer directly into the network and just left it there with an external hard drive downloading these articles to the computer.
Unknown to Swartz, his laptop and hard drive had been found by authorities.
They didn't stop the downloads.
Instead, they installed a surveillance camera.
They found the computer in this room in the basement of an MIT building.
They could have unplugged it.
They could have waited for the guy to come back and said, "Dude, what are you doing, you know, cut it out. Who are you?
They could have done all that kind of stuff, but they didn't.
What they wanted to do was film it to gather evidence to make a case.
That's the only reason you film something like that.
At first, the only person caught on the glitchy surveillance camera was using the closet as a place to store bottles and cans.
But days later, it caught Swartz.
Swartz is replacing the hard drive.
He takes it out of his backpack, leans out of frame for about five minutes, and then leaves.
And then they organized like a stakeout where, as he was biking home from MIT, these cops came out from either side of the road, or something like that, and started going after him.
He describes that he was pressed down, and assaulted by the police.
He tells me that they it's unclear that they were police that were after him.
He thought that someone was trying to attack him.
He does tell me they beat him up.
It was just devastating.
The notion of any kind of criminal prosecution of anyone in our family or anything was so foreign and incomprehensible, I didn't know what to do.
Well, they execute search warrants at Aaron's house, his apartment in Cambridge, in his office at Harvard.
Two days before the arrest, the investigation had gone beyond JSTOR and the local Cambridge police.
It had been taken over by the United States Secret Service.
The Secret Service began investigating computer and credit card fraud in 1984, but six weeks after the attack on 9/11, their role expanded.
President Bush used The Patriot Act to establish a network of what they called "Electronic Crimes Task Forces".
The bill before me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists.
According to the Secret Service, they are primarily engaged in activity with economic impact, organized criminal groups, or use of schemes involving new technology.
The Secret Service turned Swartz's case over to the Boston U.S. Attorney's office.
There was a guy in the U.S. attorney's office who had the title:
"Head of the Computer Crimes Division or Task Force".
I don't know what else he had going, but you're certainly not much of a "Computer Crimes Prosecutor"
without a computer crime to prosecute, so he jumped on it, kept if for himself, didn't assign it to someone else within the office or the unit and that's Steve Heymann.
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann has been largely out of public view since the arrest of Aaron Swartz, but he can be seen here, in an episode of the television show "American Greed", filmed around the time of Aaron's arrest.
He is describing his previous case against the notorious hacker Alberto Gonzales, a case that garnered Heymann enormous press attention and accolades.
Gonzales masterminded the theft of over a hundred million credit card and ATM numbers, the largest such fraud in history.
Here, Heymann, describing Gonzales, gives his view on the hacker mindset:
These guys are driven by a lot of the same things that we're driven by.
They have an ego, they like challenge, and of course they like money and everything you can get for money.
One of the suspects implicated in the Gonzales case was a young hacker named Jonathan James.
Believing Gonzales' crimes would be pinned on him, James committed suicide during the investigation.
In an early press release describing the government's position in the case of Aaron Swartz, Heymann's boss, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusets, Carmen Ortiz, said this:
Stealing is stealing, whether you use a computer command or a crowbar, and whether you take documents, data, or dollars.
It is not true.
It's obviously not true.
I'm not saying it's harmless, and I'm not saying that we shouldn't criminalize stealing of information, but you got to be much more subtle in trying to figure out exactly which kinds of harms are harmful here.
So the thing about a crowbar is, every time I break into a place with a crowbar, I do damage. There is no doubt about it.
But when Aaron writes a script that says download download download, a hundred times in a second, there's no obvious damage to anybody.
If he does that for the purpose of gathering an archive to do academic research on it, there is never any damage to anybody.
He wasn't stealing. He wasn't selling what he got or giving it away.
He was making a point, for as far as I could tell.
The arrest took its toll on Swartz.
He just wouldn't talk about it.
I mean, he was very stressed.
If you would thought that the FBI was going to come to your doorstep any day, anytime you went down the hall, even to do your laundry, and they'd break in into your apartment because you left the door unlocked, I'd be pretty stressed, and it was clear, and so Aaron was always sort of like in a dour mood.
He wouldn't give off any sensitive information about his whereabouts during this time, because he was so afraid that the FBI would be waiting for him.
It was a time of unprecedented social and political activism.
Time Magazine would later name, as their 2011 Person of the Year, "The Protester".
There was a kind of hotbed of hacker activity going on.
WikiLeaks had released a trove of diplomatic cables, Manning had been under arrest at the time, it was unknown whether he was the source of the leak.
Anonymous, which is a kind of protest ensemble that has a lot of hackers in its ranks, were going on various sprees of sorts.
If you compare that to what he did, this stuff should have been left behind for MIT and JSTOR to deal with, in a kind of private, professional matter.
It should have never gotten the attention of the criminal system.
It just didn't belong there.
Before he was indicted, Swartz was offered a plea deal that involved three months in prison, time in an halfway house, and a year of home detention, all without the use of a computer.
It was on the condition that Swartz plead guilty to a felony.
Here we are: we have no discovery, no evidence whatsoever about what the government's case is, and we have to make this immense decision.
Where the lawyer is pushing you to do this, the government is giving you a non-negotiable demand.
And you're told that your likelihood of prevailing is small, so whether you're guilty or not, you're better off taking the deal.
Boston has its own Computer Crimes Division, lots of lawyers, probably more lawyers than they need.
So, you know, you can imagine all sorts of cases that will be really hard to prosecute, because you've got some criminals in Russia, or you've got some people inside of a corporation that are gonna five hundred dollar lawyers or seven hundred dollar-an-hour lawyers sitting down against you, and then you've got this case with this kid.
Which is pretty easy to prove that he did something, and he's already marked himself as a troublemaker with the FBI, so why not go as tough as you can against that guy?
It's good for you the prosecutor. It's good for the Republic, because you're fighting all those terrorist types.
I was so scared.
I was so scared of having my computer seized.
I was so scared of going to jail because of my computer being seized.
I had confidential material from sources from my previous work on my laptop, and that is, above all, my priority is to keep my sources safe.
I was so scared of what was going to happen to Ada.
Aaron told me that they'd offered him a deal, and he finally just said that he would take it if I told him to, and I say I came real close to saying, "Take it".
He had these--he had developed, like, serious political aspirations between when, you know, that moment when he ended that entrepreneurial start-up life, and begun this new life that had come to this political activism, and he just didn't believe that he could continue in his life with a felony.
You know, he said to me one day, we were walking by the White House, and he said to me, "They don't let felons work there".
And you know he really--he really wanted that to be his life.
He hadn't killed anybody.
He hadn't hurt anybody. He hadn't, like, stolen money.
He hadn't done anything that seemed felony-worthy, and... there is this idea that there is no reason that he should be labelled a felon, and taken away his right to vote in many states for doing what he did. That's just outrageous.
It makes sense for him to be maybe fined a bunch of money, or asked not to come back to MIT again.
But to be a felon?
To face jail time?
Swartz turned down the plea deal.
Heymann redoubled his efforts.
Heymann continued to press us at all levels.
Even with the physical evidence seized from Aaron's Acer computer harddrive and USB drive, the prosecutors needed evidence of his motives.
Why was Aaron Swartz downloading articles from JSTOR, and just what did he plan to do with them?
The government claim was that he was planning to publish these.
We don't really know whether that was his real intention because Aaron also had a history of doing projects where he'd analyze giant data sets of articles in order to learn interesting things about them.
The best evidence for that was that when he was at Stanford, he also downloaded the whole Westlaw legal database.
In a project with Stanford law students, Swartz had downloaded the Westlaw legal database.
He uncovered troubling connections between funders of legal research and favorable results.
He did this amazing analysis of for-profit companies giving money to law professors who wrote law review articles which were then beneficial to, like, Exxon during an oil spill.
So it was a very corrupt system of funding, you know, vanity research.
Swartz had never released the Westlaw documents.
In theory, he could have been doing the same thing about the JSTOR database.
That would have been completely okay.
If he were, on the other hand, intending to create a competitive service to JSTOR, like, we're going to set up our own, you know, access to the Harvard Law Review and charge, you know, money for it, then, okay, now it seems like criminal violation because you are commercially trying to exploit this material, but it's kind of crazy to imagine that that was what he was doing.
So, but then there's the middle case:
well, what if he was just trying to liberate it for all of the developing world?
But depending on what he was doing, it creates a very different character to how the law should be thinking about it.
The government was prosecuting him as if this was like a commercial criminal violation, like stealing a whole bunch of credit card records, that it was that kind of crime.
I don't know what he was going to do with that database, but I heard from a friend of his that Aaron had told him that he was going to analyze the data for evidence of corporate funding of climate change research that led to biased results, and I totally believe that.
I was just told that Steve wanted to talk to me, and I thought this was a way I could get out of this, just exit the situation, and I didn't want to live in fear of having my computer seized.
I didn't want to live in fear of having to go to jail on a contempt of court charge if they tried to compel me to decrypt my computer.
When they came to me and said, "Steve wants to talk to you", that seemed reasonable.
They offered Norton what is know as a "Queen For A Day" letter or a proffer.
It allowed prosecutors to ask questions about Aaron's case.
Norton would be given immunity from prosecution herself, for any information she revealed during the meeting.
I didn't like it.
I told my lawyers repeatedly that I didn't...this seemed fishy, I didn't like this, I didn't want immunity, I didn't need immunity.
I hadn't done anything, but they were really, really stringent that there was they did not want me meeting the prosecutor without immunity.
But just to be clear, this is a "Queen For A Day" deal, a proffer.
Right, a proffer letter.
-In which you basically handed information to them in exchange for protection from prosecution.
So, it wasn't handing information over.
It was--at least that's not how I saw it it was just having a discussion, having an interview with them.
Well, they're asking you questions... They're asking me questions.
and they can ask about whatever they want...
-Right.
and whatever they learn... I really... They can't have you prosecuted.
Right, and I repeatedly tried to go in naked.
I repeatedly I repeatedly tried to turn down the proffer letter.
I was ill.
I was being pressured by my lawyers.
I was confused.
I was not doing well by this point.
I was depressed, and I was scared, and I didn't understand the situation I was in.
I had no idea why I was in this situation.
I hadn't done anything interesting, much less wrong.
We went out of our minds.
Aaron was clearly very distraught about it.
We were very distraught about it.
Aaron's attorneys were very distraught about it.
We tried to get Quinn to change attorneys.
I was very unused to being in a room with large men, well-armed, that are continually telling me I'm lying, and that I must have done something.
I told them that this thing that they were prosecuting wasn't a crime.
I told them that they were on the wrong side of history.
I used that phrase. I said, "You're on the wrong side of history.
And they looked bored. They didn't even look angry. They just looked bored, and it began to occur to me that we weren't having the same conversation.
I mean, I told them plenty of things about, you know, why people would download journal articles, and eventually--I don't remember what was around it.
I mentioned that he'd done this blog post, the "Guerilla Open Access Manifesto".
This is the "Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto", supposedly written in July, 2008 in Italy.
"Information is power.
But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves".
"The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations".
"Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by".
"You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends".
"But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground".
"It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew".
"But sharing isn't immoral, it's a moral imperative".
"Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy".
"There's no justice in following unjust laws".
"It's time to come into the light and, in a grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture".
The Manifesto itself was allegedly written by four different people, and also edited by Norton.
But it was Swartz who had signed his name to it.
When it's over, I go immediately to Aaron and tell him everything I can remember about it, and he gets very angry.
The things that I'd done shouldn't have added up that way.
I hadn't done anything wrong, and everything had gone wrong, but I was never... I'm still angry.
I'm still angry that you could try your best with these people to do the right thing, and they'd turn everything against you.
And they will hurt you with anything they can.
And in that moment, I regret that I said what I did.
But my much larger regret is that we have settled for this.
That we are okay with this.
That we are okay with the justice system, a system that tries to game people into little traps so they can ruin our lives.
So yeah, I wish I hadn't said that.
But I'm much, much angrier that this is where I am.
That this is what we, as a people, think is okay.
They used every method that I think they could think of to get her to provide information which would be unhelpful to Aaron, and helpful to the prosecution of Aaron, but I don't think she had information that was helpful to the government.
Months go by as Swartz's friends and family await a looming indictment.
In the meantime, Swartz was becoming a go-to expert on a series of internet issues.
Do you think that the Internet is something that should be considered a human right, and something that the government cannot take away from you?
Yes, definitely, I mean this notion that national security is an excuse to shut down the Internet, that's exactly what we heard in Egypt and Syria and all these other countries, and so, yeah, it's true, sites like WikiLeaks are going to be putting up some embarassing material about what the U.S. government does.
And people are going to be organizing to protest about it, and try and change their government.
You know, and that's a good thing, that's what all these First Amendment Rights of free expression, of freedom of association are all about.
And so the notion that we should try and shut those down I think, just goes against very basic American principles.
A principle, I think, is one that our Founding Fathers would have understood.
If the internet had been around back then, instead of putting "post offices" in the Constitution, they would have put "ISPs".
Well, it's definitely interesting to see how far... Swartz meets activist Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, and the two begin to date.
We need a massive global public outcry.
If there's no massive global public outcry, it won't create any change.
-You know, four people in this city should cause a massive global public outcry.
You know, we need a petition signer.
Without telling her specifics, he warned her he was involved in something he called simply "The Bad Thing".
And I had sort of crazy theories, like, that he was having an affair with Elizabeth Warren or something.
I speculated both Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, actually, but... So, sometime in probably late July, Aaron called me, and I happened to pick up, and he said, "The Bad Thing" might be in the news tomorrow.
Do you want me to tell you, or do you want to read about it in the news?
And I said, "Well, I want you to tell me".
Aaron said, "Well,I've been arrested for downloading too many academic journal articles, and they want to make an example out of me".
And I was like,That's it?
That's the big fuss? Really?
It just doesn't sound like a very big deal.
On July 14, 2011, federal prosecutors indict Swartz on four felony counts.
He gets indicted on the same day that two people in England who are part of LulzSec get arrested, and a few other real hackers.
And Aaron is just someone who kind of looks like a hacker, enough that they can, you know, put his head on a stake and put it on the gates.
Aaron went to surrender, and they arrested him.
They then strip searched him, took away his shoelaces, took away his belt, and left him in solitary confinement.
The District of Massachusetts United States Attorney's Office released a statement saying, "Swartz faces up to 35 years in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release, restitution, forfeiture and a fine of up to one million dollars".
He is released on one hundred thousand dollars bail.
The same day, the primary victim in the case, JSTOR, formally drops all charges against Swartz, and declines to pursue the case.
JSTOR they weren't our friends--they weren't helpful or friendly to us, but they also were just kind of like, "We're not part of this".
JSTOR, and their parent company, ITHAKA, also sidestepped requests to talk with this film.
But at the time, they released a statement saying, "It was the government's decision whether to prosecute, not JSTOR's".
And so it's our belief that, with that, the case will be over.
That we should be able to get Steve Heymann to drop the case, or settle it in some rational way.
And the government refused.
Why?
Well, because I think they wanted to make an example out of Aaron, and they said they wanted the reason why they wouldn't move on requiring a felony conviction and jail time was that they wanted to... they wanted to use this case as a case for deterrence.
They told us that.
- They told you that? - Yes.
-This was going to be an example? -Yes.
-He was going to be made an example? - Yes.
Steve Heymann said that.
Deterring who?
There's other people out there running around logging onto JSTOR, and downloading the articles to make a political statement?
I mean, who are they deterring?
It would be easier to understand the Obama administration's posture of supposedly being for deterrence if this was an administration that, for instance, prosecuted arguably the biggest economic crime that this country has seen in the last hundred years the crimes that were committed that led to the financial crisis on Wall Street.
When you start deploying the non-controversial idea of deterrence only selectively you stop making a dispassionate analysis of law-breaking.
And you started deciding to deploy law enforcement resources specifically on the basis of political ideology, and that's not just undemocratic, it's supposed to be un-American.
Prosecutor Stephen Heymann later reportedly told MIT's outside counsel that the straw that broke the camel's back was a press release sent out by an organization Swartz founded called "Demand Progress".
According to the MIT account, Heymann reacted to the short statement of support, calling it a "wild internet campaign" and a "foolish move"
that moved the case from a human one-on-one level to an institutional level.
That was a poisonous combination: a prosecutor who didn't want to lose face, who had a political career in the offing, maybe, and didn't want to have this come back and haunt them.
You spend how many tax dollars arresting someone for taking too many books out of the library, and then got your ass handed to you in court?
No way!
I then moved to try to put pressure on MIT in various ways to get them to go to the government, and request the government to stop the prosecution.
What is MIT's reaction to that?
There doesn't seem to be any reaction from MIT at that point.
MIT doesn't defend Aaron which, to people inside of the MIT community, seems outrageous, because MIT is a place that encourages hacking in the biggest sense of the word.
At MIT, the idea of going and running around on roofs and tunnels that you weren't allowed to be in was not only a rite of passage, it was part of the MIT tour, and lockpicking was a winter course at MIT.
They had the moral authority to stop it in its tracks.
MIT never stood up and took a position of saying to the Feds, "Don't do this".
"We don't want you to do this. You're overreacting. This is too strong".
I'm aware of.
They acted kind of like any corporation would.
They sort of they helped the government, they didn't help us, unless they felt they had to, and they never tried to stop it.
MIT declined repeated requests to comment, but they later released a report saying they attempted to maintain a position of neutrality, and believed Heymann and the U.S. Attorney's office did not care what MIT thought or said about the case.
MIT's behaviour seemed really at odds with the MIT ethos.
You could argue that MIT turned a blind eye, and that was okay for them to do, but taking that stance taking that neutral stance, in and of itself was taking a pro-prosecutor stance.
If you look at Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, they started by selling a Blue Box, which was a thing designed to defraud the phone company.
If you look at Bill Gates and Paul Allen, they initially started their business by using computer time at Harvard, which was pretty clearly against the rules.
The difference between Aaron and the people I just mentioned is that Aaron wanted to make the world a better place, he didn't just want to make money.
Swartz continues to be outspoken on a variety of internet issues.
You know, the reason the internet works is because of the competitive marketplace of ideas, and what we need to be focusing on is getting more information about our government.
More accessibility, more discussion, more debate, but instead it seems like what congress is focused on is shutting things down.
Aaron thought he could change the world just by explaining the world very clearly to people.
Flame can literally control your computer, and make it spy on you.
Welcome, Aaron. Good to have you back on the show here.
You know, just like spies used to in olden days, put microphones and tap what people were saying, now they're using computers to do the same things.
Swartz's political activity continues, his attention turning to a bill moving through Congress designed to curb online piracy.
It was called "SOPA".
Activists like Peter Eckersley saw it as an enormous overreach, threatening the technical integrity of the Internet itself.
And one of the first things I did was to call Aaron.
And I said, "Can we do a big online campaign against this"?
"This isn't a bill about copyright".
It's not?
"No," he said, "it's a bill about the freedom to connect".
Now I was listening.
And he thought about it for a while, and then said, yes.
And he went and founded Demand Progress.
Demand Progress is an online activism organization, we've got around a million and a half members now, but started in the fall of 2010.
Aaron was one of the most prominent people in a community of people who helped lead organizing around social justice issues at the federal level in this country.
SOPA was the bill that was intended to curtail online piracy of music and movies, but what it did was basically take a sledgehammer to a problem that needed a scalpel.
If passed, the law would allow a company to cut off finances to entire websites without due process, or even to force Google to exclude their links.
All they needed was a single claim of copyright infringement.
It pitted the titans of traditional media against a new and now far more sophisticated remix culture.
It makes everyone who runs a website into a policeman, and if they don't do their job of making sure that nobody on their site uses it for anything that's even potentially illegal, the entire site can get shut down without even so much as a trial.
This was over the top, I mean, this was a catastrophe.
This bill poses a serious threat to speech and civil liberties for all who use the internet.
There were only a handful of us who said, "Look, we're not for piracy either, but it makes no sense to destroy the architecture of the Internet, the domain name system and so much that makes it free and open in the name of fighting piracy, and Aaron got that right away.
The freedoms, guaranteed in our Constitution, the freedoms our country had been built on would be suddenly deleted.
New technology, instead of bringing us greater freedom, would have snuffed out fundamental rights we'd always taken for granted.
And I realized that day, talking to Peter, that I couldn't let that happen.
When SOPA was introduced in October 2011, it was considered inevitable.
Our strategy, when it first came out, was to hopefully slow the bill down, maybe weaken it a little bit but, even we didn't think that we would be able to stop this bill.
Having worked in Washington, what you learn is that, typically in Washington, the legislative fights are fights between different sets of corporate monied interests.
They're all duking it out to pass legislation, and the fights that are the closest are when you have one set of corporate interests against another set of corporate interests, and they're financially equally matched in terms of campaign contributions and lobbying.
Those are the closest ones.
The ones that aren't even fights, typically, are ones where all the money is on one side, all the corporations are on one side, and it's just millions of people on the other side.
I haven't seen anything like PIPA and SOPA in all my time in public service.
There were more than forty United States senators on that bill as co-sponsors, so they were already a long, long way to getting the sixty votes to have it clear all the procedural hoops.
Even I began to doubt myself. It was a rough period.
Swartz and Demand Progress were able to marshal enormous support using traditional outreach, combined with commonly used voiceover IP, to make it very easy for people to call Congress.
I've never met anybody else who was able to operate at his level both on the technological side and on the campaign strategy side.
Millions of people contacted Congress and signed anti-SOPA petitions.
Congress was caught off guard.
There was just something about watching those clueless members of Congress debate the bill, watching them insist they could regulate the Internet, and a bunch of nerds couldn't possibly stop them.
I am not a nerd.
I'm just not enough of a nerd... Maybe we oughta ask some nerds what this thing really does.
Let's have a hearing, bring in the nerds... Really?
"Nerds"?
You know, I think, actually the word you're looking for is "experts"... to enlighten you so your laws don't backfire and break the Internet.
We use the term "geek" but we're allowed to use that because we are geeks.
The fact that it got as far as it did, without them talking to any technical experts, reflects the fact that there is a problem in this town.
I'm looking for somebody to come before this body, and testify in a hearing and say, "This is why they're wrong".
There used to be an office that provided science and technology advice, and members could go to them and say, "Help me understand X,Y,Z".
And Gingrich killed it. He said it was a waste of money.
Ever since then, Congress has plunged into the Dark Ages.
I don't think anybody really thought that SOPA could be beaten, including Aaron.
It was worth trying, but it didn't seem winnable, and I remember, maybe a few months later, I remember him just turning to me and being like, I think we might win this.
And I was like,that would be amazing.
Calls to Congress continue.
When the domain hosting site Go Daddy becomes a supporter of the bill, tens of thousands of users transferred their domain names in protest.
Within a week, a humbled Go Daddy reverses their position on SOPA.
When the congress people that supported the record and movie industries, realized that there was this backlash, they kind of scaled the bill back a little bit.
You could see the curve happening. You could see that we are... that our arguments were starting to resonate.
It was like Aaron had been striking a match and it was being blown out, striking another one, and it was being blown out, and finally he'd managed to catch enough kindling that the flame actually caught, and then it turned into this roaring blaze.
On January 16, 2012, the White House issued a statement saying they didn't support the bill.
And then this happened:
I'm a big believer that we should be dealing with issues of piracy, and we should deal with them in a serious way, but this bill is not the right bill.
When Jimmy Wales put his support toward blacking out Wikipedia, the number five most popular website in the world, this is a website that's seven percent of all of the clicks on anywhere on the internet.
Wikipedia went black.
Reddit went black.
Craigslist went black.
The phone lines on Capitol Hill flat out melted.
Members of Congress started rushing to issue statements retracting their support for the bill that they were promoting just a couple days ago.
Within 24 hours, the number of opponents of SOPA in Congress went from this to this.
To see congressmen and senators slowly flip sides throughout the day of the blackout was pretty unbelievable.
There was like a hundred representative swing.
And that was when, as hard as it was for me to believe, after all this, we had won.
The thing that everyone said was impossible, that some of the biggest companies in the world had written off as kind of a pipedream, had happened.
We did it.
We won.
This is a historic week in internet politics--maybe American politics.
The thing that we heard from people in Washington, D.C., from the staffers on Capitol Hill was:
they received more emails and more phone calls on SOPA Blackout Day than they'd ever received about anything.
I think that was an extremely exciting moment.
This was the moment when the internet had grown up, politically.
It was exhilarating because it's hard to believe it actually happened.
It's hard to believe a bill with so much financial power behind it didn't simply sail through the Congress.
And not only did not sail through, it didn't pass at all.
It's easy sometimes to feel like you're powerless, like when you come out on the streets and you march and you yell and nobody hears you.
But I'm here to tell you today, you are powerful.
So, yeah, maybe sometimes you feel like you're not being listened to, but I'm here to tell you that you are.
You are being listened to. You are making a difference.
You can stop this bill if you don't stop fighting.
Stop PIPA.
Stop SOPA.
Some of the biggest internet companies, to put it frankly, would benefit from a world in which their little competitors could get censored.
We can't let that happen.
For him, it was more important to be sure that you made a small change than to play a small part in a big change.
But SOPA was like playing a major part in a major change, and so for him, it was kind of this proof of concept like,Okay, what I want to do with my life is change the world.
I think about it in this really scientific way of measuring my impact, and this shows that it's possible.
The thing that I want to do with my life is possible.
I have proved that I can do it, that I, Aaron Swartz, can change the world.
For a guy who never really thought he had done much which was Aaron it was one of the few moments where you could really see that he felt like he had done something good, feeling like here is his maybe one and only victory lap.
Everyone said there was no way we could stop SOPA.
We stopped it.
This is three outrageously good victories, and the year isn't even over yet.
I mean, if there's a time to be positive, it's now.
You know, he wins at SOPA a year after he's arrested.
It's not unambiguously happy moments. There's a lot going on.
He's so attuned towards participating in the political process, you can't stop him.
The list of organizations Swartz founded or co-founded is enormous, and years before Edward Snowden would expose widespread internet surveillance, Swartz was already concerned.
It is shocking to think that the accountability is so lax that they don't even have sort of basic statistics about how big the spying program is.
And if the answer is: "Oh, we're spying on so many people we can't possibly even count them"
then that's an awful lot of people.
It'd be one thing if they said Look, we know the number of telephones we're spying on, we don't know exactly how many real people that corresponds to.
but they just came back and said, "We can't give you a number at all".
That's pretty--I mean, that's scary, is what it is.
And they put incredible pressure on him, took away all of the money he had made.
They, you know, threatened to take away his physical freedom.
Why'd they do it, you know? I mean, well, why are they going after whistleblowers?
You know, why are they going after people who tell the truth about all sorts of things, I mean, from the banks, to war, to just sort of government transparency.
So secrecy serves those who are already in power, and we are living in an era of secrecy that coincides with an era where the government is doing, also, a lot of things that are probably illegal and unconstitutional.
So, those two things are not coincidences.
It's very clear that this technology has been developed not for small countries overseas, but right here, for use in the United States, by the U.S. government.
The problem with the spying program is it's this sort of long, slow expansion, you know, going back to the Nixon administration, right, obviously it became big after 9/11 under George W. Bush, and Obama has continued to expand it, and the problems have slowly grown worse and worse, but there's never been this moment you can point to and say, "Okay, we need to galvanize opposition today because today is when it matters".
The prosecution, in my estimation of Aaron Swartz, was about sending a particular, laserlike message to a group of people that the Obama administration sees as politically threatening.
And that is, essentially, the hacker, the information, and the democracy activist community.
And the message that the Obama administration wanted to send to that particular community was, in my estimation, "We know you have the ability to make trouble for the establishment.
And so we are going to try to make an example out of Aaron Swartz to scare as many of you as possible into not making that trouble.
And the government said, "Oh, the legal opinions we're using to legalize the spying program are also classified, so we can't even tell you which laws we're using to spy on you".
You know, every time they can say, "Oh, this is another instance of cyberwar.
The cybercriminals are attacking us again. We're all in danger. We're all under threat".
They use those as excuses to push through more and more dangerous laws.
And so just to follow--personally, how do you feel the fight is going?
It's up to you!
-I know. It's just that we gotta, you know... You know, there's sort of these two polarizing perspectives, everything is great, the Internet has created all this freedom and liberty, everything's going to be fantastic.
Or everything is terrible, the internet has created all these tools for cracking down and spying, and controlling what we say.
And the thing is, both are true, right?
The Internet has done both, and both are kind of amazing and astonishing and which one will win out in the long run is up to us.
It doesn't make sense to say, "Oh, one is doing better than the other." You know, they're both true.
And it's up to us which ones we emphasize and which ones we take advantage of because they're both there, and they're both always going to be there.
On September 12, 2012, federal prosecutors filed a superseding indictment against Swartz, adding additional counts of wire fraud, unauthorized access to a computer, and computer fraud.
Now, instead of four felony counts, Swartz was facing thirteen.
The prosecution's leverage had dramatically increased, as did Swartz's potential jail time and fines.
They filed a separate indictment to add more charges, and they had a theory about why this conduct constituted a number of federal crimes, and that a very significant sentence could attach to it under the law.
That theory, and much of the prosecution's case against Swartz, involved a law created originally in 1986.
It is called the "Computer Fraud and Abuse Act".
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was inspired by the movie War Games with Matthew Broderick--great movie.
I have you now.
In this movie, a kid gets the ability, through the magic of computer networks, to launch a nuclear attack.
You know, that's not actually possible, and it certainly wasn't possible in the '80s but apparently this movie scared Congress enough to pass the original Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
This is a law that's just behind the times, for example, it penalizes a Terms of Service kind of arrangement. You can have something like eHarmony or Match.com, and somebody sort of inflates their own personal characteristics.
All of a sudden, depending on the jurisdiction and the prosecutors, they could be in a whole host of troubles.
We all know what "Terms of Use" are.
Most people don't read them, but not abiding by their terms could mean you are committing a felony.
The website Terms of Service often say things like:
"Be nice to each other," or "Don't do anything that's improper".
The idea that the Criminal Law has anything to say about these kinds of violations, I think, strikes most people as crazy.
The examples get even more "crazy":
Until it was changed in March of 2013, the Terms of Use on the website of Hearst's Seventeen magazine said you had to be eighteen in order to read it.
I would say that the way the CFAA has been interpreted by the Justice Department, we are probably all breaking the law.
Vague and prone to misuse, the CFAA has become a one-size-fits-all hammer for a wide range of computer-related disputes.
Though not the only factor in his case, eleven of the thirteen charges against Swartz involved the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
The question "Why?" hangs over much of the story of Aaron Swartz.
Just what was motivating the government, and what would their case have been?
The Department of Justice declined requests for answers, but Professor Orin Kerr is a former prosecutor who has studied the case.
So, I think I come about this case from a different direction than other people on a number of reasons.
I was a federal prosecutor at the Justice Department for three years before I started teaching.
The government came forward with an indictment based on what crimes they thought were committed, just as a purely lawyer's matter, looking at the precedents, looking at the statute.
Looking at the history, looking at the cases that are out there so far, I think it was a fair indictment based on that.
You can debate whether they should have charged this case.
There's just a lot of disagreement.
Some people are on the Open Access side, some people are not.
I think the government took Swartz's "Guerilla Open Access Manifesto" very seriously, and I think they saw him as somebody who was committed, as a moral imperative, to breaking the law to overcome a law that Swartz saw as unjust.
And in a democracy, if you think a law is unjust, there are ways of changing that law.
There's going to Congress, as Swartz did so masterfully with SOPA, or you can violate that law in a way to try to nullify that law.
I think what was driving the prosecution was the sense that Swartz was committed, not just to breaking the law, but to really making sure that law was nullified, that everyone would have access to the database in a way that you couldn't put the toothpaste back into the tube.
It would be done, and Swartz's side would win.
There's a big disagreement in society as to whether that is an unjust law, and ultimately, that is a decision for the American people to make, working through Congress.
And then the second problem is, I think, we're still trying to figure out what's the line between less serious offences and more serious offences?
We're now entering this different environment of computers and computer misuse, and we don't yet have a really strong sense of exactly what these lines are because we're just working that out.
This is a poor use of prosecutorial discretion.
The hammer that the Justice Department has to scare people with just gets bigger and bigger and bigger, and so most people just... you know, you can't roll the dice with your life like that.
Should we tap somebody's phone? Should we film them?
Should we turn somebody and get them to testify against these other people?
That's how federal agents and prosecutors think.
They build cases. They make cases.
Swartz was caught in the gears of a brutal criminal justice system that could not turn back, a machine that has made America the country with the highest rate of incarceration in the world.
We have, in this country, allowed ourselves to be captured by the politics of fear and anger, and anything we're afraid of, like the future of the Internet and access.
And anything we're angry about, instinctively creates a criminal justice intervention, and we've used jail, prison, and punishment to resolve a whole host of problems that, historically, were never seen as criminal justice problems.
The impulse to threaten, indict, prosecute, which is part of what has created this debate and controversy over online access and information on the internet, is very consistent with what we've seen in other areas.
The one difference is that the people who are usually targeted and victimized by these kinds of criminal and carceral responses are typically poor and minority.
Swartz's isolation from friends and family increased.
He had basically stopped working on anything else, and the case was, in fact, taking over sort of his whole life.
One of Aaron's lawyers apparently told the prosecutors that he was emotionally vulnerable, and that that was something they really needed to keep in mind so that they knew that.
It was weighing on him very heavily.
He did not like having his actions and his movements restricted in any way, and the threat of jail, which they pounded him with a lot, was terrifying to him.
Completely exhausted his financial resouces, and it cost us a lot of money also, and he raised a substantial amount of money, so it was, you know, it was in the millions of dollars.
The legal defence? - Yes.
-Was in millions? - Yes.
I think he didn't want to be a burden to people.
I think that was a factor like, "I have my normal life, and then I have this shitty thing I have to deal with, and I try to keep the two of them as separate as possible, but they were just beginning to blur together and everything was becoming shitty.
Swartz faced a tough choice that was only getting tougher.
Do you admit guilt and move on with your life, or do you fight a broken system?
With his legal case, the answer was simple.
He rejects a final plea deal and a trial date is set.
Aaron was resolute that he didn't want to knuckle under and accept something that he didn't believe was fair, but I also think he was scared.
I don't think they would have convicted Aaron.
I think we would have walked him out of that courthouse, and I would have given him a big hug, and we would have walked across that little river in Boston, and gone and had a couple of beers.
I really thought that we were right.
I thought that we were going to win the case.
I thought that we could win the case.
He didn't talk about it very much, but you could see the enormous pain that he was going through.
No time in his childhood did Aaron have any severe mood swings or depressive episodes or anything that I would describe as "severe depression"
and it's possible, you know, he was depressed. People get depressed.
Very early in our relationship, three or four weeks in or something, I remember him saying to me that I was a lot stronger than he was.
You know, he was brittle in a lot of ways.
Things were a lot harder for him than for a lot of people.
That was part of his brilliance, too.
I think he probably had something like clinical depression in his early twenties.
I don't think he did when I was with him.
He wasn't a "joyful" person, but that's different from being depressed.
He was just under such enormous pressure for two years straight.
He just didn't want to do it anymore.
He was just I just think it was too much.
I got a phone call late at night.
I could tell something was wrong, and then I called, and I realized what had happened.
A co-founder of the social news and entertainment website Reddit has been found dead.
Police say twenty-six-year-old Aaron Swartz killed himself yesterday in his Brooklyn apartment.
I just thought, we've lost one of the most creative minds of our generation.
I was like, the whole world fell apart at that moment.
It was one of the hardest nights of my life.
I just kept screaming,I can't hear you! What did you say? I can't hear you!
I can't. That's it.
Okay.
Yeah, none of it made any sense, and really still doesn't.
I was so frustrated, angry.
You know, I tried to explain it to my kids.
My three-year-old told me that the doctors would fix him.
I've known lots of people who have died, but I've never lost anybody like this, because everybody feels, and I do too, there is so much we could have more to do like.
I just didn't know he was there.
I didn't know this was what he was suffering and... He was part of me.
And I just wanted it to not be real, and then... and then I just looked at his Wikipedia page and I saw the end date "to 2013".
Aaron is dead.
Wanderers in this crazy world, we have lost a mentor, a wise elder.
Hackers for right, we are one down, we have lost one of our own.
Nurtures, careers, listeners, feeders, parents all, we have lost a child.
Let us all weep.
Sir Tim Berners-Lee, January 11, 2013 My first thought was what if nobody even notices?
You know, because it wasn't clear to me how salient he was.
I had never seen anything quite like the outpouring I saw.
The Net just lit up.
Everyone was trying to... to explain it in their own way, but I've never seen people grieve on Twitter before.
People were visibly grieving online.
He was the Internet's own boy, and the old world killed him.
We are standing in the middle of a time when great injustice is not touched.
Architects of the financial meltdown have dinner with the president, regularly.
In the middle of that time, the idea that this was what the government had to prosecute, it just seems absurd, if it weren't tragic.
The question is: Can we do something, given what's happened, to make the world a better place, and how can we further that legacy?
That's the only question one could ask.
All over the world, there are starting to be hack-a-thons, gatherings, Aaron Swartz has, in some sense, brought the best out of us, in trying to say how do we fix this?
He was, in my humble opinion, one of the true extraordinary revolutionaries that this country has produced.
I don't know whether Aaron was defeated or victorious, but we are certainly shaped by the hand of the things that he wrestled with.
When we turn armed agents of the law on citizens trying to increase access to knowledge, we've broken the rule of law
--we've desecrated the temple of justice.
Aaron Swartz was not a criminal.
Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, it comes through continuous struggle.
Aaron really could do magic, and I'm dedicated to making sure that his magic doesn't end with his death.
He believed that he could change the world, and he was right.
Out of the last week, and out of today, phoenixes are already rising.
Since Swartz's death, Representative Zoe Lofgren and Senator Ron Wyden have introduced legislation that would reform the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act the outdated law that formed the majority of the charges against Swartz.
It's called "Aaron's Law".
Aaron believed that you literally ought to be asking yourself all of the time, What is the most important thing I could be working on in the world right now?
And if you're not working on that, why aren't you?
This is what democracy looks like!
We are the people, too!
Internet freedom's under attack! What do we do?
Stand up, fight back!
Internet freedom's under attack! What do we do?
Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Carmen Ortiz has got to go!
I wish we could change the past, but we cannot.
But we can change the future and we must.
We must do so for Aaron. We must do so for ourselves.
We must do so to make our world a better place, a more humane place, a place where justice works, and access to knowledge becomes a human right.
So there was a kid, back in February, from Baltimore, fourteen years old, who had access to JSTOR.
He'd been spalunking through JSTOR after reading something, he figured out a way to do early tests for pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic cancer kills the shit out of you, because we detect it way too late by the time we detect it, it's already too late to do anything about it.
He sent emails off to the entire oncology department at Johns Hopkins, you know hundreds of them, and every
- Did you say fourteen years old? - Fourteen-year-old kid, yeah, and most of them ignored it.
But one of them sent him an email back, and said,this is not an entirely stupid idea. Why don't you come on over?
This kid worked evenings and weekends with this researcher, and in February I heard him on the news just a couple of weeks after Aaron died, when Aaron was in the news a lot.
Sorry... and he said the reason he was on the news was because they'd done it.
They were shipping an early test for pancreatic cancer that was going to save lives, and he said, This is why what Aaron did was so important.
Because you never know, right?
This truth of the universe is not only something that policymakers use to figure out, you know, what the speed limit should be.
It's where the thing that's gonna keep your kid from dying of pancreatic cancer comes from.
And without access, the person who might come up with the thing that's got your number on it, may never find that answer.
He sleeped so well, he didn't fall out of, not even when he dreamed he was back on the spacecraft.
Very good, Aaron. Very good.
Yay, Aaron!
Okay, now it's song time.
In a cold world, all the watches started to freeze.
The sun came and went between blizzards and gusts which erased all bearings.
In this world lived a fire and in this fire, two lovers found a home.
Katia and Maurice Krafft probably the volcanologist couple in the world who have observed the most active volcanoes.
From the deep archives of KATIA & MAURICE KRAFFT.
I wish you a good Easter with Maurice and Katia Krafft.
Hello.
The world’s greatest volcanologist is a tinv woman named Katia Krafft.
See Stephane?Most volcanoes are on the boundaries between plates.
It’s essential that you see these images and are carried away on this swirl of lava.
Fire of love.
Hello boy,how are you?
Okay.
All right. The volcano is ready, waiting for us.
Yes.
Okay.
Katia?
This is Katia, and this is Maurice.
It's 1991, June 2nd.Tomorrow will be their last day.
They will leave behind samples.
Words.
Hundreds of hours of footage.
Thousands of photos.
And a million questions.
When you’re out on the rocks,what do you talk about?
Katia only talks about eating.That’s what interests her!
Are there many volcanologist couples in the world?
I don’t know if there are any others.
Volcanologist couples?It’s extremely rare.
Volcanologists are people who study active volcanoes.
I don’t think there are any others.
Or maybe we don’t know them.
But I would pity them.
It’s hard for volcanologists to live together it’s volcanic!
We erupt often!
The other day he rushed up onto an active cone.
It was cooling down,so cracks were forming on the little cone.
So cracks were forming on the little cone.
What did he do?He fell into a hole?
They meet 19 years ago.
In 1966.
There is no definitive account of this first encounter and the visual record of their budding romance is sparse.
There is this photo and these rose-tinted moments a few years later.
Parts of Katia and Maurice's story remain lost to time.
As in love, there are mysteries.
You fall hard for what you know.
Harder for what you don't.
In one story, Katia and Maurice meet by chance on a bench at the University of Strasbourg.
Haroun Tazieff,I think you know him.
He has just released a new film.
In a second,they meet at a new film by renowned volcanologist Haroun Tazieff.
The most detailed account is a blind date at a caffe.
They bond over their first loves, Mount Etna and Mount Stromboli.
Katia, a rebel who was sent to a school for unruly girls, convinces her parents to take her to Italy's volcanoes.
My first eruption with lava flows and eruptions was on Mount Etna.
This world of stones,this mineral world.
It’s very beautiful when the lava flows in he evening.
My first impression of seeing this living land confirmed what I had imagined and read.
I went to Stromboli with my father when I was 7 and it fascinated me.
The earth has always interested me.
Some days,I lived in the dinosaur era, other days,I was with the trilobites.
I was crazy about that as a kid.
Maurice would return to Stromboliat age 19, feeling at once ecstasy and loneliness.
Katia understands this loneliness.
It is also hers.
Growing up in the rubble of postwar Alsace, the world felt to them unsafe, uncertain.
They take refuge in the mysteries of the natural world.
Dreaming, just 20 kilometers apart.
The Vosges and Rhine fault lines shifting imperceptibly beneath them.
At the end of this version, the cafèŒ… closes and it begins to rain.
They will never leave each other.
November 19th, 1967, a U.S. fighter plane drops two snake-eye bombs along the South Vietnam border the territory once colonized as French Indochina.
One week later,Katia and Maurice join anti-war protests in Paris.
The next day, they show up on the front page of L'Humanitè.
But human pursuits of power begin to feel vain and absurd next to the power of the Earth.
Both Katia and I got into volcanology because we were disappointed with humanity.
And since a volcano is greater than man, we felt this is what we need.
Something beyond human understanding.
It's also the plate tectonic revolution, and the field of volcanology is finding its form.
The discovery and confirmation of plate tectonic theory and continental drift is as important as the discovery of the atom for physics.
They devour each hypothesis, each myth.
Everything that has been gleaned so far from the archives of the Earth.
The truths... the fragments... the questions.
They wonder what forms and re-forms the world.
To these mysteries they long to get closer.
With just enough grant money and a donated car, Katia and Maurice go seek Iceland's volcanoes with their friend, Roland.
Katia is the geochemist,Maurice the geologist.
Alone, they could only dream of volcanoes.
Together, they can reach them.
Except the car breaks down 27 times.
Then crashes.
And Maurice gets into hot water.
Here is an actor reading Katia's account.
I was finishing up my measurements traces of hydrogen sulfide and a little hydrochloric acid.
Happy with my results,I walk over to Maurice.
What is he looking at with such interest?
The skin of his right ankle is peeling like an onion!
Yeah,my right leg was burned in hot mud.
140 degrees,hot enough for me!
It’s a volcanologist baptism.
Undeterred, they spend the next few summers studying their mutual friends studying their mutual friends, Etna and Stromboli.
They also bring along more human friends.
It’s a delicate operation,sampling these gases in vials.
There are many setbacks.
We climb up in pants and go down in briefs and panties.
Katia and Maurice are after the strange alchemy of elements, the combination of mineral, heat,gas and time that incites an eruption.
What is it, they ask, that makes the Earth's heart beat?
Its blood flow?
They study, examine and question.
Katia and Maurice begin to learn the secrets of the planet that few others know.
Understanding is love's other name.
Once you see an eruption,you can’t live without it, because it’s so grandiose,it’s so strong.
That feeling of being nothing at all.
Being in these untamed elements.
1970,Katia and Maurice marry in a small ceremony in Alsace.
They honeymoon on the volcanic island of Santorini, believed to be the secret location of Atlantis.
Katia and Maurice decide they will not have children.
From here on out, life will only be volcanoes, "volcanoes, volcanoes",Maurice says.
No,this is not a science fiction movie.
It’s two young volcanologists dancing on the edge of a volcano.
They are Katia and Maurice Krafft.
Today:Man and volcanoes.
A volcanic bomb?What does that mean?
A volcanic bomb is a rock ejected by a volcano, often in the form of lava.
The easiest way is to show you one.
A bomb from Vulcano.
Is it heavy?
They can be a few tons,but this one is a kilo or two.
Anyway,on your head,it wouldn’t feel pleasant!
Maurice Krafft,do volcanoes have different personalities?
Have you tried to classify them?
Volcano classifications should be banned.
You can’t classify a volcano.Each has a unique personality.
Not to be mean, but it’s the old beards and academics who classify things, forcing a whole generation to use their models.
There’s no truth in this.
It’s better to study each volcano separately and avoid abusive classifications.
It’s a product that selectively shows down the gases.
When a gaseous mixture goes into the device... The young field of volcanology has found two young stars.
These samples you brought back are very pretty and very colorful,for viewers with color TV.
The camera loves them.
And they love their own cameras back.
Photography is a means of remembering, revisiting, stretching their time with volcanoes.
You film all your expeditions?
Yes,it’s how we observe them.
Then we can re-watch the images and study them, because it all happens too fast when it’s in front of you.
This photo shows the parabolic trajectories of volcanic bombs ejected from Stromboli.
This one shows how lava is stretched into glass wool called Pele's hair.
And this shot helps visualize plate tectonic theory.
Volcanology is a science of observation.
The closer they get, the more they see.
Are you considered “traveling performer volcanologists”?
Americans would call us freelance.
But it’s true that we’re like traveling performers.
Volcano runners.
We live by the rhythms of the earth.
And the Earth decides where we go next.
Katia,do you feel like you lead an alternative life?
For me,certainly not.
But certain colleagues see us as weirdos.
The very instant a volcano wakes up,these weirdoes are notified by a growing network of local friends and guides who help them reach the craters as fast as humanly possible.
Maurice and Katia make their expedition to Nyiragongo, a volcano that sits between two diverging plates.
They are guided by fellow volcanologist Jacques Durieux.
You arrive at the mouth of the volcano, then you have to go in the mouth of the volcano.
So you are going down.
Not so high, 300 meters. But very bad rock.
All kinds of fumaroles went through, and so it's not strong.
Here, Maurice and Katia make their home for the next two weeks.
Katia would later write We contemplate,lying at the edge of the abyss, The phenomenon,relentless,makes us shiver.
Suddenly, the lava plunges down ten meters in seconds.
Maurice says we are crazy to stay here.
And yet, we remain.
Curiosity is stronger than fear.
Katia and Maurice will eventually emerge from this crater unscathed and emboldened.
We get very close to volcanoes.That isn’t hard to do.
This type,the red volcanoes,they are friendly.
In the immense universe that is the classification of volcanoes, the Kraffts will eventually adopt two general classes.
Red... and gray.
When people imagine lava flows,those are the reds,the nice ones.
Then you have the grey volcanoes,the killers,the explosive ones.
Red volcanoes, like Nyiragongo,form as tectonic plates pull apart, and at hotspots on the ocean floor.
Magma rises and fills in the gaps opened up by the movement of the Earth, creating new land.
Red volcanoes are basaltic.
Effusive.
And up to 1200 degrees Celsius hot.
Getting killed on a red volcano is very difficult.
Because a lava flow always funnels through a valley,like a river.
We know where it’s going.
It’s no more dangerous than walking on a road in Belgium or elsewhere.
It’s true!It’s a question of calculated risk.
Katia and Maurice have their differences.
Katia is like a bird.
Maurice, an elephant seal.
Katia is drawn to details, the interconnectedness of things.
Maurice, the singular, the grandiose.
They both observe the world, but in their own distinct ways.
Katia, with her still camera, captures one moment with one frame.
Maurice chases motion recording a stream of seconds, 24 frames each.
He thirsts to get every possible shot, because the spectacle could vanish.
But this causes him to wander... and wander... and wander.
Katia's greatest fear is that she will lose sight of him and never see him again.
This is a volcanologist trap.
You fall into the lava,it makes a few sparks.
It’s game over for the volcanologist.
A surprise telegram summons Katia and Maurice to Nyiragongo, their beloved volcano that they met four years ago.
Katia and Maurice knew this kind of destruction was possible.
But this is the first time they experience it firsthand.
The lava flows were going very fast.
They were probably running at 60 to 70 kilometers per hour.
And this was in the morning where a lot of people were on the road going for the market.
We think that around 100 people were overwhelmed by the lava flow.
Very unusual eruption.
These are perfect impressions of elephant bodies.
Even the trunk and tail are imprinted in the lava.
No amount of scientific research could have prepared them for this shock.
The language of myth instead feels apt.
They're in the cauldron of the devil,the portal to hell.
Or caught amid the warring spirits of the volcano, according to the stories from their friends in Goma.
For Katia and Maurice, the unknown is not something to be feared.It is something to go toward.
At only 52 years old an infant Indonesian volcano begins to throw a fit.
Katia and Maurice go chase it.
In 1883, its parent, a volcano named Krakatau, exploded.
It conjured a tsunami so forceful that it swept neighboring coastlines, killing 36,417 people.
It also ripped up this coral from the seafloor and parked a colonial Dutch steamship two miles inland.
Ash traveled the globe, intensifying sunsets that transfixed the gaze of scientists and artists, especially one Norwegian painter who described the sunsets as a scream.
Then the volcano collapsed into the sea only to spring up again as a newcomer called Anak Krakatau.
Katia and Maurice must be totally in sync.
Any mistake that one makes can be costly for the both of them.
But Maurice cannot do this work without Katia.
Neither can Katia, without Maurice.
And together, they're there for the volcano, who is indifferent in the face of their adulation.
Katia and Maurice know that these rocks will long outlive them.
They are not religious.
"We are scientists," they say.
"We have but this one short life, then we return to the ground."
With her one short life, Katia dreams of growing old with the volcano, of turning over its every stone.
Maurice burns to get closer to the fire, no matter what.
He once wrote, Maurice hatches this plan from another boating adventure during their first trip to Indonesia in 1971.
Here, they study the largest reserve of sulfuric acid in the world.
Suddenly, the acid eats through the steel cable and claims the sample bottle at the bottom of the lake.
This mission is over.
A headwind sweeps them further from shore.
They will spend the next three hours struggling to get back.
Katia is furious.
Over time, Maurice perfects the legend of Maurice Krafft.
And together,he and Katia have gotten good at playing themselves.
Despite what Maurice says,their footage suggests otherwise.
For instance, how do they show that their work is grueling?
Perhaps like this?
Or this?
How do they show how to gaze into the abyss?
Perhaps like this.
How do they stage geologic scale?
With images like this?
But what about this?
Why was this moment captured with their rationed feet of film?
What or who was it for?
Now and again, Katia and Maurice must go back to Alsace to turn their photos and footage into books and films.
Here, they are denizens of this human world.
In order to get back home to the volcano,they must pay the bills.
Katia catalogues their images, writes the booksand handles the logistics.
Maurice takes the lecture tour, media appearances, tries in vain to plan his lava canoe trip.
He also edits their films.
Ball is in.
Danger.
Over in the United States, volcanologist Harry Glicken takes this photo of Mount St. Helens on May 17, 1980.
What follows are some of the best-known images of what will happen here tomorrow, starting at eight hours, 32 minutes, 11.4 seconds Pacific Daylight Time.
Fifty-three kilometers to the east on Mount Adams, a hiker takes these photos.
Fifty-six kilometers to the northwest,this image is taken.
Somewhere further, an eight-millimeter film camera records this.
As for Maurice and Katia, they did not film or photograph this eruption because they could not see or hear it.
As ash descends on the surrounding area Katia and Maurice make their approach.
Katia and Maurice will spend three months amid the ash monitoring, photographing, studying this force.
And little by little, they and their fellow researchers will paint a clearer picture of the event, with numbers like two point eight, the number of cubic kilometers of land cast off by the mountain.
Twenty-five thousand, the eruption's force measured in atomic bombs like the one that the United States dropped on Hiroshima.
Fifty-seven, the official human death toll.
At one point, they will find the melted tapes of David Johnston.
No matter what they discover after the blast they come no closer to understanding how to make the most critical measurements before it.
From this moment on,they will devote their lives to this kind of volcano.
The gray volcano.The killer volcano.
Gray volcanoes may be killers, but their ash makes the most fertile soil in the world, as demonstrated by this killer turnip.
Unlike red volcanoes, which form when plates pull apart, grays form when plates collide, causing pressure and heat to build and build until a cataclysmic release.
A Who's-Who of such eruptions would include Vesuvius in the year 79, Tambora in 1815,and PelèŒ…e in 1902.
Here is a relatively small one,Galunggung, in 1982.
And here's Una-Una in 1983.
There may be signs before an eruption, but there is no certainty. No way of knowing the exact timing.
And timing is everything in the human world.
In 1884,time was set to machines instead of the wild rhythms of the Earth.
No longer told by the Sun, Moon or stars, it relied on manufactured intervals to coordinate railway cars transporting minerals ripped from the Earth.
Embraced by the British Empire, this new railway time soon mapped the globe.
But a volcano can't be scheduled.
The length of the fuse is never known.
This is a map drawn of Nevado del Ruiz,a gray volcano in Colombia's Andean range.
It illustrates the threat if it erupts. And there's every indication that it will, as Colombia's geoscientists communicated to officials in reports.
This one, presented on October 7, 1985, states that there is a 100 percent probability of mudflows, with great danger for Armero and the surrounding towns.
Katia and Maurice are part of a chorus who call for warning systems and evacuation plans.
They know what will happen.
But the decision-makers deem these plans too costly.
On November 14, 1985, these images circulate around the world.
The volcano erupted the previous day, and the mudflows swallowed the villages late at night,while residents slept.
Katia arrives while Maurice is on a lecture tour in France, promoting their latest film.
The official death toll climbs to 22,000 and then 23,000.
Some reports say 25,000.
The exact number is not known.
Survivors would later recount.
Katia longs for Maurice,who is likely lecturing at this moment on the creative powers of volcanoes.
For the first time, she questions her life's purpose.
Katia and Maurice had spent their livesdocumenting how the Earth's heart beats, how its blood flows.
Now they feel their own human hearts beating and breaking.
Long ago, Maurice said... Volcanoes must destroy to create but must this unruly cycle take human life?
Katia and Maurice set out to hunt for the rarest, deadliest forces for a new film on volcanic hazards.
It took them one full year to get these shots on Alaska's Mount Augustine.
The camera shakes as if it's telegraphing,whether to stay or run.
Perhaps it is because their colleague, Juergen Kienle, is about to pull them away from the burning ash cloud at the last second.
Several years from now, their obituary will cite this as the moment where Katia and Maurice insisted that the risks should always be minimized but that this type of close-up study had to be done.
Maurice once said, Look at how small we humans are against this volcanic force.
The only thing that will remain of our passage is that we can write, tell stories, and film.
When you could die at any moment what do you leave behind?
A set of forces collide inside the planet throughout the enormity of geologic time to trigger one instant, an eruption, that forever re-shapes the Earth.
And across humanity's two million years, two tiny humans are born in the same place, at the same time, and they love the same thing.
And that love moved us closer to the Earth.
June 3rd, 1991, Mount Unzen begins to wake up after its 200-year slumber.
The mountain has been stirring since May, but today, something will shift inside the Earth.
We hope always, but we cannot be sure and we don't know nothing.
You have big blocks on the top and they have to come down, but when?
Just after 4:00 p.m., it starts to rain.
Ash blows in on a north wind.
Something seems different this time.
The mist obscures their view,so Katia and Maurice push closer with their friend, Harry Glicken, to get a better shot.
A journalist who abandoned their camera captured this shot.
And there's this moment, just before the blast.
The last known shot of Katia and Maurice together.
Japanese officials gave Katia and Maurice's friend, Yves, this photo.
Their urns resting in the Shimabara Temple at the base of Mount Unzen.
Near the site of the surge, the marks on the earth indicated that Katia and Maurice were next to each other.
Two items were recovered.A camera and a watch, its hands forever frozen in timeat 4:18 p.m.
Just over the East China Sea, Mount Pinatubo trembles.
In one week, it will explode in the most spectacular volcanic eruption the Philippines has ever known.
Fifty-eight thousand people will evacuate.
Officials took the warning signs seriously, thanks to Katia and Maurice's film about understanding volcanoes.
Across the world, near the French-German border, the Vosges and Rhine fault lines shift imperceptibly beneath a sleeping Earth.
I gave every part of my youth to do a job and to go through a savage war.
It was a different war from year to year and one's reactions were completely different.
The intensity changed so much that anybody who'd been out in 1914 and went home, then came back in 1917, wouldn't recognise it as the same war.
I could only say one thing: I wouldn't have missed it.
It was terrible at times, but I wouldn't have missed it.
Yes,if I could have my time again, I'd go through it all over again because I enjoyed the service life.
I could only say that I have never been so excited in my life.
This was like a boy going to the play for the first time.
I never realised there was anything unusual about it.
There was a job to be done and you just got on and did it.
We were all instilled with that idea that this was war and that we'd got to kill the Germans and this was how we looked at the thing.
I don't regret having experienced it.
I wish I hadn't, but I don't regret it, because I'm safe.
There were good times and bad times in France, but you took the rough with the smooth.
I was twice wounded and gassed, but it just didn't worry me.
I just made the best of it.
Just took it in its stride, like everybody else.
We were glad to be in it and we expected it to be rough, and it was rough, but we didn't complain.
There was no real excitement about it.
You'd seen death so many times, you'd seen wounded so many times, blood didn't excite you.
We were professionals and, to us, it was just a job of work.
It would be a fallacy to say that one enjoyed it, but one got afterwards a nice, warm inner feeling that one had been of some use.
It didn't affect me very much, because I wasn't sufficiently up in the ways of the world.
I was only a kid, like other blokes there.
It was more like a great, big game to be enjoyed, apart from the actual shelling and all that sort of thing.
It made me a man, yes, it did.
I don't think I should have ever been the man I am if it hadn't been for having to serve.
You'd learn to look after yourself whereas, in your civilian life, your mother did all the chores.
You've got to learn how to cook for yourself, darn your own socks, sew on your own buttons and all the things like that.
It was just a day's work.
I knew that I was not alone.
I knew that I wasn't fighting the war by myself and that what happened to other people might happen to me.
I had no regrets at all but, you see, I had no wife, no girl, no nothing.
No regrets and no horrors because, if you survive that, you can survive anything.
We were aware there was sort of a nasty feeling between England and Germany, as we knew of the Kaiser's ambition to expand his empire and all that sort of thing.
During that summer, there was a lot of talk about trouble going on in the Balkans, but we were a long way from the Balkans and it didn't worry us at all.
It was that Serbia business, wasn't it?
Serbia, when that chap was shot.
I was paying attention to politics and I realised there was going to be trouble between England and Germany.
It was a lovely August 4th morning.
We were all seated round the table and we were starting the rugby football dinner with the German team.
There was a German here and next to him was an Englishman, and next to him was a German, and so on and so on.
And a runner arrived into the middle of this dinner with extraordinary news of outbreak of war.
There was a big placard: "War declared on Germany."
We didn't know what we ought to do, whether we ought to seize a knife off the table and plunge it into the German or what, but after a little bit of discussion we decided that, as far as we were concerned, the war was going to start tomorrow, and the party proceeded.
I'm proud of being a Britisher.
I think we're as good a country as any in the world and you've got to be prepared to fight for that.
There's no doubt about it, in the First World War, we prepared for war.
The Empire was strong. We weren't afraid of anyone.
Everybody bought little buttons and waved flags and sang songs.
There was no feeling of despair about it at all.
England couldn't possibly lose, no matter how many Germans pushed how many Englishmen into the Channel, they'd get no further.
We couldn't possible lose.
We were brought up to think that one Englishman's worth ten Germans.
I thought that any enemy of England was an enemy of mine and I wanted to be in it.
Six months or 12 months and it'd be all over and Bob's your uncle.
I went with a friend of mine into Shepherd's Bush Empire to see the picture show there and they showed the fleet sailing the high seas and played, "Britons never shall be slaves."
One feels that little shiver run up their back and you know you've got to do something.
A friend of mine said to me, "We're going to join up."
It was from the patriotic point of view and from the general excitement of the whole affair, I suppose.
I didn't believe in war to that extent, but I was prepared to do my part.
In those days, men weren't to think for themselves.
They just had to do what they were told and that's all there was to it.
My mother was very aggrieved about it but,a young man, you decide you're going to go.
At lunch time, I left the office, went along to Armoury House and there was a queue of about 1,000 people trying to enlist.
Everybody thought that it would be a civilised war and wanted to be fit enough to go.
Two of us decided to join up together and when we told the boss we were going to start training on Monday, he was very annoyed.
He didn't make any promise that our jobs would be there when we got back.
My mother, she said, "You wait until you're 19."
See, that was the age in those days, 19 to 35.It was supposed to be.
We were all lads together, you know, full of excitement and all this kind of thing.
I just wanted to have a go at Jerry.
I just thought that I'd like to go and fight for the country.
You were proud of your country and you'd do the best you could for it and this was what most of the young people thought of doing in those days.
My mother, she said to me, we could stop you doing this because of your age.
I said, "yes, I know you could, Mother, but I'm sure you won't, which they never did.
l just felt that all the young fellas of that age were volunteering and I thought it was my job to do the same.
I was desperately keen.
A whole heap of us went.
I said, "Direct enlistment, please."
They were highly delighted and pushed me in as quick as lightning.
Lots of the lads were joining the local regiments, like the Bucks and the Middlesex.
Lads that I knew and been to school with, played football and cricket with, we joined up, hoping for the best.
We were good friends, comrades and it was a relief from rather boring jobs at home.
I was walking down the Camden town High Street when two young ladies approached me.
Why aren't you in the army?
I said, "I'm only 17."
"Oh, they all say that here."
And to my amazement, she put her hand in her bag and I put my hand up to sort of safeguard myself when this white feather finished up my nose.
As we marched to the station, some of the chaps had bowler hats, some had straw hats, some had the regulation peaked army cap.
Some would have tunics, some would be dressed with their ordinaryjackets with a pair of army trousers.
Some had army boots, some didn't, and we really were a motley throng.
Some of them were obviously chaps who had hoped to live in some comfort and brought suitcases with clothes with them which they never saw again.
We had to all get our hair cut.
"How would you like it, sir?"
And you'd say, "Short back and sides,"
but the answer was straight over the top with horse clippers and we looked more like convicts than soldiers.
As soon as war broke out, there was a call made for all ex-soldiers to rejoin and they made 'em sergeants straightaway, so you got a lot of instructors that way.
The people who really carried us through was the old sweats who'd had previous war experience and gave us a lot of wise advise as to what to look for and what to dodge.
We were ordered down onto the parade ground and then we were allotted to different platoons.
When they came to us, they were weedy, sallow, skinny, frightened children.
The refuse of our industrial system and they were in very poor condition and had to be made into soldiers.
Many of us had given our wrong ages to join the army.
The adjutant walked down the lines and gave an order, every man under the age of 19 to take two paces forward.
Nobody moved.
I was a lad of 17, and they'd probably see I wasn't 19, which you had to be to join up, but they says, "How long do you want to sign on for?"
Everybody else was joining up, so I went into the recruiting office.
He said to me, "How old are you?" I said, "17, sir."
"Well," he says, "Go outside and come back and say you're 18."
So I went outside and said I were 18.
Then straight to the sea for Flanders.
The sergeant said, "How old are you?"
I said, "I'm 18 and one month."
He said, "Do you mean 19 and one month?"
So I thought a moment.
I said, "Yes, sir." He said, "sign here, please."
He asked me how old I was and I said I was 16 in March.
he said you're too young.
You'd better go outside and have a birthday.
I was 16 years old in 1917, and I was six-foot-two tall, and my father allowed me to go.
So I entered my age as 19 years old, three years older than what I really was.
I was 15 years, just two-and-a-half years short of 18, and I got before this medical officer who said, "All right, you pass."
I was just turned 17 at the time, and I went up to Whitehall and enlisted in the 16th Lancers.
I was 15, and I thought I'd have a better chance than when I were 14, so I walked into the barracks and just said, "I'm 18," and that was it.
My parents wrote to the commanding officer and asked for me, as I was underage, to be released.
He said, "Your parents want you back. Do you want to go?"
I said, "No."
The chaplain asked me my age and I said I was 16.
He said much too young.
Would you like me to pray for you?
The clothing came piecemeal into the quartermaster's stores.
One lad said,these boots don't fit me.
The quartermaster said there isn't such a thing as boots that don't fit, it's your feet, they don't fit the boots.
Some men would find a tunic to fit them or perhaps a pair of trousers.
And so it went on for nearly a fortnight. Just one uniform.
I was in the army nearly four years. I only had one uniform.
We were all issued with these famous puttees, which were news to all of us, and I personally could never quite master the putting on of puttees.
The main reason for puttees were to support the legs in marching.
I was issued with a kilt, but nothing to wear underneath it, and I was given a slip of paper to say, this man has not been issued with underpants.
I was given strict instructions that I couldn't ride on top of a tram car.
I had to ride downstairs.
The pack was for everything that you owned.
The overcoat had to be folded very neatly and tightly.
There was a needle, thread, spare buttons, knife, fork, spoon, razor, shaving brush, toothbrush, and also a half-pint mug, one spare shirt and one spare pair of socks, and that was your kit.
The army razor with which we were issued was absolutely useless, but it came in handy for cutting up meat and so forth.
The toothbrush, that came in handy for cleaning buttons.
One of the peculiarities about the army was, although it was a crime to have dirty buttons, you were never issued with the materials to clean the buttons with.
You had to buy them yourself.
We were awakened by the bugle which sounded Reveille.
Wash, shave, pack your bed up and pack your kit about half-past six and you would have an hour PT before breakfast.
Press-ups and physical exercises, arms upward stretch.
They knew you were fresh and they tried to take you by stages.
There wasn't any bullying or anything like that.
Breakfast consisted of bread, butter, one rasher of Lance Corporal bacon, because it was streaky bacon, it had one stripe in it.
There was jam and they seemed to make nothing but plum and apple.
If you got any other kind, it was a celebration event.
Bruce Bairnsfather's cartoons depicted that.
They'd hand him a tin of plum and apple jam.
When the hell is it goin' to be strawberry?
He was wonderful, that chap.
Ticklers, the jam manufacturers, they must have made millions of tins of plum and apple.
Then it would be parade time, then the sergeant would take over and you would have a whole morning of marching.
And you would learn all commands, such as "About turn," and all that sort of thing.
Having been in the Boy Scouts, it was dead easy to me.
When you get the order, you turn your head only to the right.
Some of them managed to turn left, which didn't exactly please the drill sergeant.
We were all youngsters.
We'd come from fairly sheltered lives and so forth.
This sergeant of ours was the loudmouth shouting-type.
Coming up against military discipline was a shock, being chased around from pillar to post by disciplinarian NCOs.
Some of the sergeants were shockers.
They would cause a lot of trouble if you were out of step, or if you didn't keep time, or if you didn't handle your rifle properly.
They were always having a go at you.
Most of them were all right, their shouting meant nothing, but some of them never lost it.
One night I'd gone to bed and this pot was brought round to my bed and they said did you want to do a piss?
So I did the business in the pot.
They'd rested this big, huge pot which contained gallons on the door and when this sergeant came along to see that everybody was in bed, this thing turned up and he was drenched from top to bottom in fluid.
First of all, I was full of enthusiasm.
But, after about the first week, I wished I hadn't done it because the discipline was so strict and I was beginning to get a bit nervous as to what was in store.
We weren't out dancing, anything like that.
We were getting ready for a war.
The thing was you were in the army, you had to do as you were told, you had one master, or dozens, but you just had to get on with it and that was it.
I did find that right through the army.
If you behaved yourself, you'd nothing much to fear.
This was quite a new world to us,you can imagine, I came out of civilian life like all the others did and we weren't in a position to argue or object.
It was just a matter of doing what we were told.
I liked it. I liked to be told what I had to do, because there was a reason for doing it.
Later on, I realised that was the best training you could have.
The first week, our route march would be ten miles.
The second week, it would be 12, and so on and so on.
It intensified because it's of the utmost importance that the infantry soldier could march with the full kit.
What you had to carry was 109 pounds.
Marching was easy for me, but quite a lot of chaps who were in sedentary jobs found it pretty hard.
It numbed and cramped the muscles on my thighs and calves until they hurt very much indeed.
Those army boots! I could've cried.
My feet and ankles with those heavy army boots, after civilian shoes.
So, to get your boots made pliable, you used to urinate in them and leave it overnight.
Quite a lot of men were clerks or they worked in shops and the very nature of their calling didn't make for fitness.
They sent me to hospital and they gave me the cure for hookworm and I found that I could stand the drill after that.
They used to march us all round the West End.
Crowds used to foregather.
And some of the poor, deluded ones fell for the con trick and lined up behind us and we used to march them all down to Chelsea Barracks where they got signed up.
Lunch would consist of inevitable stew.
We must remember that the chaps in the cookhouse were by no means experienced cooks, but anybody can make a stew and that's what they did.
Sometimes, we got a bit of plum duff and milk puddings and tapioca rice.
It was good, old-fashioned, plain stuff that I was brought up on.
I had no complaint about it.
In the afternoon, it could be a lecture on Vickers machine guns.
You used to strip the machine gun right down and put it together again and, luckily, I seemed to cotton on to that quite quickly.
We were always told that man's best friend is his rifle, and it was.
Our rifle was a short Lee-Enfield.
A very good rifle indeed. A real sturdy rifle.
You had your ammunition pouches on both sides of the chest to counterbalance the weight of the pack and those pouches carried 150 rounds of .303 ammunition.
We were supposed to hold a rifle with one hand, but I could never hold a rifle properly.
My right wrist wouldn't hold it up.
I'd never fired a rifle in my life but, on the first day, we went onto the rifle range and it was amazing, the bull's-eyes I was getting.
The next thing, I was made a first-class rifleman.
Above all, we learned rapid fire.
Ten rounds, get those ten rounds onto the target in one minute.
It was known as "the mad minute".
I'd never seen a dead man, or anything of that kind and I wondered, if it came to my shooting a man, whether I would be able to do this.
You'd plunge the bayonet into the sack, shout like hell.
And they would tell you where to put your bayonet.
Either into his left shoulder, his right shoulder, in the chest, or in the body.
We were told to make as much noise as we could.
I think that was to frighten the enemy.
Didn't seem a likely thing to do, but we used to shout.
When you've trained as a division, there's 12 battalions, that's roughly 12,000 men who are on the move and you're a very small cog in a big wheel.
Saturday mornings we were let off, but we had to do sometimes barrack duties.
On Sundays, we were all marched down to church.
It didn't matter what religion you were, you all had to go and that was it.
Hardly a day passed without the shout around the barrack room, has anybody here had any experiences with horses?
Can anybody here play any musical instruments?
So, gradually, the 1,000 men who joined up as a motley throng, now became a transport man, a bandsman, signalman, and so on.
You didn't wanna mess about at the parade ground with heavy packs on the route marches.
Most of us wanted to go across and do some scrapping.
After good food, fresh air and physical exercise, they'd changed so that their mothers wouldn't have recognised them.
They'd put on an average of one stone in weight and one inch in height.
Although we hated the sight and sound of our disciplinary sergeants, this reflects greatly to their credit because they knocked us into shape as regards to marching and foot drills.
But, far more than that, they were handsome, ruddy, upstanding, square-shouldered young men who were afraid of nobody, not even the sergeant major.
After six weeks, we were informed we were gonna be posted overseas.
They said you're leaving tomorrow morning for an unknown destination.
You were never told where you were heading for.
I just wanted to fight the Germans and, as far as that was concerned, it didn't matter tuppence to me where we went.
And when we pushed them through this crash programme of military training, they were pushed off to France in batches.
Before we left, the officer said, Well you haven't had time to be made sergeants, so we'll give you a couple of stripes.
So they made us corporals and, in less than no time, we were marched down to the station.
In my mind, I wondered,shall I ever come back?
I didn't think I would at the time.
I didn't worry about it.
They were all full of euphoria.
They were all glad they were going. Nobody was crying.
I wrote a postcard when I was in the train and chucked it out the window, hoping that it would be delivered to my family.
We arrived at Folkestone in the evening.
We embarked on one of the old Thames pleasure boats.
Of course, it's only 21 miles from Dover to Calais on the boat.
There were talks by officers to us as to how to behave ourselves on foreign soil and that we'd got to respect other people's modes of conduct.
The biggest number of casualties were NCOs and we weren't all too keen about this.
So I went into the lavatory and my stripes came off and they disappeared through the porthole.
And with that, I went back on deck as a private.
As our horses were brought down the gangways, I noticed the expression on the men's faces.
There were no cheerful, smiling faces coming down that gangway at all.
It was beautiful weather. Very warm.
Every village and town we went through, people rushed out, bottles of wine, yards of French bread.
The land flowed in every single aspect.
There were farmers going about their business, the most lovely country.
If we were passing a field of carrots, we used to raid the field and walk along munching the carrots and turnips.
I was dead scared that the war would be over before I got out to it.
When I got out to France, I was terribly pleased.
Really keen.
You just marched and marched until roughly 20 miles from the trenches.
We knew we were getting close to the line, because the gunfire was becoming more noisy.
I remember the first shell, I was delighted.
We went through towns, villages, that were absolutely derelict, so we never knew where we were, except that we were in Belgium.
The devastation was something I never could have imagined.
The whole place gave one a most eerie sensation.
There were stunted trees torn to shreds with shellfire and there were shell holes all over the place.
We were relieving men of the 28th Division and, as they passed us, we would say, "what's it like up there?"
The reply invariably came back, "Bloody awful, mate."' The old sweats coming back had got their tails up all right, but I didn't know what to expect, just hadn't a clue.
It was deadly warfare.
You were facing the Germans.
Follow me!
You got the order load.
You put nine in your magazine and one up the spout and you put your safety catch on and you always went into the line prepared to use your rifle immediately.
That's when you got rigid orders.
No talking whatsoever! Keep your head down!
Single file! No smoking!
The captain would then direct you right to the front trenches.
When a man goes into the trenches, he usually carries a roll of barbed wire or bag of bombs, beside his own equipment.
That's the way they get the stuff up to the front line.
Now a guide would always be sent out.
Extend this part of the trench over there.
- What, that way?  - That's it.
The trenches in France were a maze.
If you didn't have a guide, you could soon get lost.
Smile so your mother thinks I'm looking after you.
Now up you go. Double up!
The trenches weren't in one straight line.
They were built on what they call the traverse system.
The traverse would break up the shellfire and stop it spreading right along the trench.
There was a front line of trenches, and then there was a second line of trenches.
The support line would be about 50 yards or more behind the front line.
In between, there would be communication trenches so that they could move through if the front line was under jeopardy.
The first impression I got of the trenches was they were very much lived in.
We had to take them as we found them.
You would see an overcoat hanging from a wooden peg.
You would see a mess tin with some tea in it.
A dugout which had a piece of blanket in it.
A bed made of sandbags.
Our world was divided by no-man's-land, a sort of iron curtain beyond which were bogeymen who would kill you if they ever saw you.
As you looked through your periscope all you could see were hundreds of shell holes, your barbed wire and the German barbed wire.
You could see dead bodies hanging on the barbed wire and they may have been there for a long, long time.
It was one of the most desolate-looking places in the world.
You never saw a sign of life and yet you knew very well that, within shouting range, there were hundreds and hundreds of men.
A platoon of about 50 men would have about 100 yards of frontline trenches, their responsibility.
There were signs all over the trenches Piccadilly Circus and Regent Street, and all that sort of thing, telling you where the water points were, and which was the most dangerous part of land with regard to snipers.
You had to be extremely careful because a bullet would go through one layer of sandbags quite easily.
I was talking to a bloke one clay and plop!
His head was smashed in like an egg.
He just happened to be in a place where a sniper could get an aim on him.
We used to do a four-day stint in the line.
We took with us sufficient food to last the four days.
Got any grog?  See you later on.
My best to Jerry.
Mind yourselves. That's it.
Your day would start before dawn, when NCOs would go round this 100 yards to make sure everybody was alive.
Of a day in the trenches, you had two hours on, four off.
A third of the people on sentry duty, a third working and a third sleeping.
No beds, just flopped down on the ground.
You're in the pictures, mate.
The trench was very wet and, wherever possible, we would try and get above the water.
We were able to dig out a side of the trench and that was when we used to steal our sleep on the two-on four-off stretch.
Then you'd have your couple of hours on the parapet and then rest again.
If nothing untoward happened, there would be perhaps two or three sentry groups in the whole company's front.
It was a job to keep awake and woe betide you if you were caught asleep.
If you are so tired, you can sleep standing up, which I've done many times.
The first thing you did when you got into the line was to have a brew up.
There was one thing about the Vickers gun, it being a water-cooled weapon, if you were continuously firing, you'd find that the water'd be boiling.
You could disconnect the tube and make a cup of tea.
The water came up in two-gallon petrol cans.
And we could taste the petrol in it, because they couldn't wash it completely out.
In every bay was a little fireplace.
Let's get this lit.
You used tiny slivers of wood, because if you made smoke in the front line, over would come a shell.I fancy a brew.
You'd save a drop of that tea to shave with.
Because we had to shave in the front line.
We used to put a lot of tins out on the parapet if it rained.
You dare't touch any of the other water.
We were scooping water off shell holes.
There might have been dead bodies underneath.
As long as we boiled it for a long time, all the green stuff'd come off the top.
Anyway, we made tea with it.
That's how I got my dose of dysentery.
Of course, there were no sanitary arrangements.
They'd dig a trench and stick a pole across.
You'd get about seven or eight chaps on the pole.
God! To have a clear out was terrible.
People used to go to the toilet with no privacy.
Being rather a shy nature, if I pissed with somebody, I felt a bit nervous but, when you're in the army, you got quite used to it.
It didn't matter a damn, because there's no women or anything like that.
The flies used to crawl all over your bottom.
Most unpleasant.
We had no such thing as toilet rolls.
You had to wipe your behind with your hand.
Your hands might have been in all sorts, but you never washed.
You heard a terrific shout and the pole had snapped and the four men who were sitting on the bar fell down in the muck.
There was always a humorous side of the war.
We had to put rifles down for them to hang onto and they came out like slimy rabbits and nobody wanted to go near them.
We had no spare clothes at all and you were living for weeks without washing or getting a bath.
And I personally became really badly infested and "chatty" as we used to call it, with these lice.
Lice was a dreadful problem.
They were funny little things, like little lobster sort of things with six legs and they used to feed ten times a day.
You had to kill the bloody things.
My favourite way was burning them.
You would run the seams over a lighted candle and you could hear the eggs going pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop!
The sooner you got your shirt back again, the heat of the body hatched the eggs that you'd missed.
We were just as lousy next day.
Each man prepared his own breakfast.
Bread and jam.
It was about 16 men to a loaf of bread.
There'd be a little of bacon, which would suffice for half a dozen men.
You put your rasher of bacon in your mess tin lid, put a few more sticks on your fire and you would fry your bacon and then soak up the fat with a piece of biscuit.
Then there you are with a breakfast.
Dinnertime was mostly bully beef cut up and stewed along with all sorts of vegetables from tins.
Magonoghie's tinned stew was mixed up with the bully beef.
I've got into French dugouts and eaten biscuits which have been left by the troops two years' previously and tasted the green mould in them, but they didn't do me any harm.
This was how it was and anything's good,when you're hungry.
And people were always hungry.
At any given moment, you can expect to be shelled.
You got very little protection against that.
One would hear a mild pop as the gun fired five miles away.
- Sir, here. Very good.
In the five or six seconds it took for them to come, you can pass through quite a number of psychological changes.
Steady!
I can't remember anything more nerve-wracking than the continuous shelling, without stop, day and night.
'We were always told that you never heard the shell that hit you because most of them travelled faster than sound.
You could literally feel your heart pounding against the ground.
The emotional strain was absolutely terrific.
Although a shell might burst 50 yards away, you might find a fragment of jagged iron really red hot and weighing half a pound arriving in your trench.
You'd seen people blown to little bits.
I've actually had to put a man in a sandbag.
Every now and again, there would be a great roar like an aeroplane coming in to land.
And, in a fifth-of-a-second, your resolution would break and you'd throw yourself into the mud and the other ones laugh at you.
The shrapnel shell would burst in the air and spray bullets on the troops below as if they're from a shotgun.
The bullets came down, whistling like all the hobs of hell.
Another one of the annoyances we had was that the Germans were very active with mining.
We crouched down underneath the front parapet to dodge the debris falling and I got the men to open up rapid fire to prevent the Germans from getting into that crater where they could bomb us.
As the front line gets damaged, it's got to be repaired.
The people who were in the line, they've got to get on with it.
I had in my mind that we expected big gunfire to light amongst all us cavalry and absolutely swipe us off the face of the earth.
I shouted,Gallop! like that!
And they dropped them all amongst the horses.
A heck of a mess.
The horses were laying down with their intestines hanging out and men with matter hanging out their heads.
Regroup!
The boys, they said,Bloody Germans!
To lose a horse was like losing a friend.
Ready! The brigadier turned to our captain.
He said, see that the boy has two or three days' rest.
When a boy likes an animal like that, there's not a lot wrong with him.
Over the whole of the front line, there was a smell.
It wasn't a complicated smell.
It was the smell of decaying corpses.
Nasty, sickly smell.
You never forgot that smell.
It was the smell of death.
If you've ever smelt a dead mouse, it was like that, but hundreds and hundreds of times worse.
It seemed to cling to everything.
When you were having your food, you could taste it.
The awful stench and bits of human bodies lying about, it became an everyday thing.
You thought, it'll be your turn next. What does it matter?
Wherever there was a grave or a body, there were rats.
They were all big, fat ones and we knew where they got their fat from.
Unpleasant animals, because of the filtration into the graves.
They used to feed on the dead and come in the dugouts, pick up scraps in there.
I woke up at the bottom of the trench and felt something warm on my face and a little heart went bang-bang-bang-bang-bang.
The devil scratched my face with the claws of his hind feet as he took off.
We'd try and shoot them, hit them, kill them, chase them, do anything.
Then you've got gas.
We saw this green cloud coming toward us, just rolling slowly along the ground.
They'd shout gas!
and we had to take our mask out and stick it on in two or three seconds.
It was phosgene gas. Later on, there was mustard gas.
That was very effective.
I never saw a slightly gassed" man.
If you couldn't get your gas mask, you were to pee on your handkerchief and stuff this round your nose and mouth.
I don't mind admitting I didn't think much of urinating on handkerchiefs, so I went into one of the trench latrines and I stuck my head in the bucket.
I'll tell you, I couldn't hold my breath any more, came up, took a good breath of air, down again.
We were very soon enveloped in this thick, yellow, filthy cloud.
The more we tried to get rid of the stinging in our eyes, the worse it got.
I thought deeply of what the effect of blindness was going to be.
But the extraction of clotted blood and the injection of saline could alleviate a lot of the trouble and, as I was gassed myself, I can speak from experience.
In the wintertime, as the weather deteriorated, so the trenches got more and more sodden with water until they just became ditches.
The water was swirling about our feet and rising higher and higher until it reached our chests.
Our difficulty was frostbite.
Our gumboots filled with water and, in the mornings, we could not strip them off, because they were frozen to our feet.
When you're talking about trench feet, you're talking about gangrene.
Send him straight down the line. Hack the legs off.
Give us a hand with that.
When the water had soaked into the earth, the floors of the trenches were just paved with liquid mud and that became like glue.
It was a curious, sucking kind of mud.
Very viscous indeed.
Very tenacious. It stuck to you.
If one had to go to the rear for rations, that was just a nightmare journey, slithering about.
When it was pouring with rain, and on slippery duckboards, the language was really edifying.
You heard words that you never dreamed existed.
If you slipped off the duckboards, you sank into the mud of decomposed bodies of humans and mules, and that was the end of you.
The boy was in the middle of this huge sea of mud, struggling, and we couldn't do a thing.
There was no hope of getting to him.
The look on the lad's face, and he was only a mere boy, was really pathetic.
I've seen men sinking into the mud and dying in the slime.
I think it absolutely finished me off.
It was supposed to be quiet, then you might get some drunken German say, I'm gonna give them hell today,open up with all his batteries and catch hundreds of people unaware.
That was what they called "holding a line".
We were in conditions that isolated us completely from civilisation.
We got so degenerate, so isolated, living in this mud.
And you could sympathise with how a rabbit must feel, because we were hunted by mankind just the same as a rabbit.
You knew your lives were in one another's hands and it united you closely and you didn't let anything interfere with that.
What was going on within your vision.
Beyond that, you hadn't got a clue.
You didn't care how the war was going, whether you were winning.
You weren't bothered with that at all.
You lived like tramps. You didn't polish any buttons.
You wore any uniform bits that you liked and nobody worried.
All they were concerned with was that you were fit to fight.
If nothing's happened, you'd chat about life, where he came from, where you came from.
Everything was friendly.
There was a terrific lot of kindness in a way to each person.
When the war was not very active, it was really rather fun to be in the front line.
It was not very dangerous.
A sort of out-of-door camping holiday with the boys with a slight spice of danger to make it interesting.
We used to raid the trenches and get a prisoner if possible.
On a typical trench raid, there'd be perhaps eight in the party.
If you were going to make a raid, somebody would cut a passage through the wire at night.
The only way to do it was silently to rush it, and that was the arrangement.
We would bayonet the Germans coming out on their hands and knees out the dugout, we'd smack them over the head, and throw in a couple of bombs.
There were three ways of getting rid of him.
One was to knife him, garrotte him, or to bayonet him.
The quietest was a quick wrap around the throat and a knife into the back.
I threw the revolver at poor little Rudolph.
He was only about 18. I hit him in the face with it.
He screamed and came back at me and that's when I got him.
Got him with a Very pistol.
I gave him a drink. I felt very sorry for him.
Pick up prisoners, lads!
And it was a very successful little raid.
They got two prisoners, I think, which was all they all wanted.
By the way, the men who were captured on the trench raids were the first Germans I saw on the Western Front.
What else is there?
A lot of the German troops were very good, very friendly.
In fact, some of those Bavarians were damn good, decent people.
The snipers would fire, but not hit anybody, know what I mean?
They put up a sign: "Gott mit uns," in German".
We put up a sign up in English, "We've got mittens too."
We don't know if the Germans enjoyed that joke or not.
There was a wounded German, a Wartenberger.
We did what we could for him, we gave him a bit of food, that sort of thing.
He was cursing the Prussians like anything.
The Saxons were in front of us and they gave us the warning that they were going to be relieved by the Prussians.
And they said to us,give them hell!
They hated the Prussians.
Because the Prussians were cruel bastards.
This way.
Watch yourself!
The Bavarians or the Saxonians were the more civilized of the Germans.
Part-English, if anything.
After a four-day spell in the front line, we were relieved and we had to march back to billet somewhere a few miles behind the lines.
We were going for a supposed one-week's rest.
Everybody was dead whacked.
We were all pretty knocked up.
We extricated ourselves from the mud to what was somewhat ironically called "rest".
In the front line itself, you didn't criticise people.
If you had a chap who was a bit dicky, you would keep an eye on him.
It was like being a family ,but when you were out of the line, you'd want nothing to do with those people at all.
You can't call it comradeship, exactly, it was the way you did it.
Get your mail! Welcome back.
The thing which always took me as being absolutely stupid was that the next morning, every man had to be spick and span, not a trace of mud on him.
You'd brush your clothes or dry them off the best way you could and clean your boots.
In other words, smarten yourself up.
The men would always appear the same cheerful under the circumstances, happy as they could be, and making the best of everything, in true British fashion.
The Cockney wit was prevalent.
We were all lads together.
We didn't care a bugger.
We'd make a fuss about nothing.
Little things that didn't matter really, because it was something to fill the time in.
We used to have to make our own amusements.
Bloody bastard.
You laughed at the slightest things.
I think probably it was the general tension of the atmosphere that used to make us like that.
My mother sent me a parcel with a plum pudding of all things and I had no thought of being able to cook it, so we used it as a rugby ball.
We had this regimental sports day and I won't say I was the only sober one, but most of them were merry about it.
Come on. Sock him one!
I mean, you took part in everything, because you had to fill your time in, otherwise all you did was sit about and smoke.
The only time we saw the artillerymen was when we were out at rest.
They would be two miles behind the line.
We wanted to neutralise enemy batteries, so we were registering our batteries on his.
- Fire! - Come on!
We used to know the line and elevation because it was done by aircraft.
Once they're through, go again!
lt's pretty ghastly, but the idea was to kill as many German gunners as you could. Ready!
Fire!
There was no motorised transport then for guns.
The guns used to be brought up by horses.
Eight horses to each gun team. Four horses to each wagon team.
About 60 horses.
The gunners made a filthy noise, jingling and jingling and the horses making noises both ends and it was always a great concern for those of us who were going to battle.
- Come on! - Heave!
Each company officer paid his own company.
It was generally the first morning after we were out of the line, you got five francs.
A franc was worth ten pence, so 50 pence was your pay for a fortnight. 50 pence.
Now, that's a week of riotous living.
Every town of any size at all had a brothel and that was where most of these boys learnt a little more about life than they would ever have done in normal, civil life.
So, although they were young in years, it wasn't long before they were quite worldly men.
One of the lads said let's go and have a look in the White Star!
It's like a pub.
I'd led a very sheltered life and there were beautiful girls with just a piece of lace on.
I'd never seen anything like it before.
There was I, the young lads, knowing nothing about this.
Off we go and these men were going up regularly to see the girls.
I was very keen. I said to one of these fellas,I've only got a six pence.
That was my first experience of a brothel.
We looked in there for a couple of minutes, when four or five naked girls came running down the corridor.
We turned tail and ran!
It was an eye-opener to me.
There she stood, a great big woman with this little cane in her hand and she belted my backside as if I was a little schoolboy.
Gambling! Good Lord! People were gambling all day long.
The Canadians and Australians used to gamble terrific amounts of money, more money than I'd ever seen.
The beer was very thin indeed.
It was one-and-nine stuff.
One pint, nine piddles.
'Friday was always the issue day for cigarettes.
And the cigarettes were Three Witches, which soon became "Three Bitches", or Red Hussars.
I think they were made from stable returns.
But, generally, in good-sized villages, you could get Woodbines and Player's and they were far preferable to the issue cigarettes.
Of course, we were always bartering with the Frenchmen.
We used to barter some of our under-clothing and get a loaf of bread.
We used to swap our British cigarettes for their French wine.
It could be just as tiring out of the line as in the line and it was sometimes worse.
If you were chosen for a fatigue, you'd have to go on the working party.
You collected stores from a big dump three or four miles back.
Enormous bundles of sandbags, ready made-up duckboards and, worst of all, barbed wire.
That's that.It was always hard work.
You were a bonny, labouring boy more than you were a fighter.
All the chaps were very tired, but it made no difference.
They were mentally tired out.
They'd come out of a trench tour for a rest and this was the rest they were getting.
Tuck it down now.
You would be carrying stuff up on a light railway.
Yes, they laid a narrow-gauge light railway track.
It was the simplest of things, just platforms on wheels, driven by light locomotives.
Light railways, well, they were always a blooming nuisance, because they were always coming off the track.
They lost control of this truck going down a slight incline and it barged into the one in front, scattered duckboards all over the place.
We used to take our mess tins up to the engine driver and get some boiling water for our brew up of tea.
Stop messing around. And another.
Second line there.
The Germans could see the steam and smoke from the steam engine, so then it was mostly petrol engines which used to run up to the trenches.
The light railway only went as far as the communication trench and then we had to push the thing along by hand.
Somebody came along and said this is it!
We're gonna be home by Christmas.
Just go down the road and look in a field there, you'll see.
Wouldn't tell us why. Anyway, we went down.
They were on the roadside covered with tarpaulin sheets.
You could see nothing except a square outline.
And then the officer said, these are supposed to be hush-hush.
When we asked what it was, the simple reply was, "Tanks."
Knowing the shortage of water, we naturally assumed water tanks and thought we were getting reserve supplies.
It was one of the best-kept secrets.
We were delighted as these wonderful machines were going to win the war and soon everybody'd be home again.
Of course, it didn't happen like that.
We were taken out of the line and had intensive training.
Plunge the bayonet into the sack, shout like hell.
It was to get used to plunging them into somebody's body.
Then we fired our rifles on the rifle range.
Firing rifle grenades was a specialist job.
But they were clumsy.
I didn't like them much.
Forced marching, marching without a rest and also frontal attack, right flank attack, left flank attack, both flanks attack, night attack and we wondered what the devil all this training was for.
The corps commander said that he had just received instructions to go ahead with an operation to break through the German lines.
Come on, Wellington!
We were told to parade, full marching order.
We had to go back up the front.
We'd only been out of the line a couple of days.
We could see streams of supplies, mostly ammunition columns going up towards the front.
We didn't have a lot of notice, but we knew there was gonna be a big advance.
Batteries pushed forward, forward positions filled up with ammunition.
Let's get these ladders up!
As our great push drew nearer, the line livened up, it began to get much more dangerous and not nearly so much fun.
We learnt that a bayonet charge was to be made on German machine guns.
I wish it to be impressed on all ranks, the importance of the operations about to commence.
The Germans are now outnumbered and outgunned and will soon go to pieces if every man goes into the fight determined to get through whatever the local difficulties may be.
I am confident that the brigade will distinguish itself in this, its first battle.
Let every man remember that all England is watching him.
We marched all through the night and it got so bad that officers at the side were pushing men back into line who were straggling out and your legs seemed to go automatically forward.
I had a feeling that we were walking in our sleep.
More men were brought into the line and regiments were crowded closer together.
We were filling up the trenches, packed in like sardines.
Our captain was a splendid man.
He would never bark an order at you.
He would give an order in a conversational way.
We don't know how far this trench is, but it's between 200 and 300 yards.
I will go over in the first wave and you'll be in the second wave and as soon as the curtain fire starts, we move.
Now, go along and tell your men to be ready.
And this is the sort of order we got.
Our two assaulting companies were ignorant of what their conduct would be when they got into action.
Captain Neville thought it might be helpful if he could furnish each platoon with a football and allow them to kick it forward and follow it.
I think myself that it did help them enormously. Took their minds off it.
We had an extra bandolier of ammunition around our necks and if you didn't have a shovel, you had a pick.
We got in the trenches and we waited for zero hour.
All the watches are synchronised.
I was what is called a first bayonet man, which meant I carried the rifle with the bayonet in the attacking position and the rest of the men carried bags of bombs.
And we warned to be ready to advance at any moment.
Any moment was quite a long time coming.
Of course, that added to the tension that we were feeling.
Mind the wire!
My platoon had been told to go out and test the fire.
We had to get out and walk towards the enemy.
We went about 200 yards and then they called us back again.
There was to be no preliminary bombardment the days beforehand.
There was only one short, sharp barrage just before the battle.
Fire!
You've got to have the artillery preparation to smash their wire down.
Fire!
I ordered fire on possible enemy assembly and forming-up positions.
The bombardment started.Ready!Fire!
We could see the hundreds and hundreds of gun flashes.
Ready! Fire!
Fire one!
Fire two! Fire three!
Fire four!
As soon as the bombardment started, the Germans' retaliation came.
For four hours, we had to sit there and take everything he slung at us.
First of all, a large number of tanks went in.
We could hear them rumbling and rattling.
320 tanks crawling along.
We waited for the signal to move off.
Already, everybody was anxious to go, but we waited and waited.
We got no sleep that night, owing to the noise of our artillery barrage, which was continuous the whole time.
We were asked to hand over any personal belongings to our company officer, such as photographs and letters that we valued.
I heard soft voices talking to one another quietly and I wondered how many were going to live to see the sun rise.
In a man's pay book, there was provision for making a valid will, if they were going into action for the first time, but I didn't bother.
I had nothing to leave anybody.
The fellow next to you, he was your best friend.
You loved him.
You perhaps didn't know him the day before and then an hour to go.
They were the longest and the shortest hours in life.
We had unlimited time for thinking and I know I found myself thinking much more deeply than I had ever thought before.
Some people might be incapable of thinking.
They might have regarded the situation as being such that they were incapable of thought.
I don't think there was any fear.
It was just that we were doing a job and if it came, it came.
We realised that, sooner or later, we were going to get the chop.
You were either going to be killed or wounded.
I was not in the least frightened of being killed, but I was terrified lest I should lose an arm or a leg.
Waiting for an hour for an attack is not a very pleasant thing.
We sort of chatted away, trying to keep the spirits up, you see.
We told dirty stories and made crude remarks.
We had 1,000 guns massed on a mile front behind us.
You imagine all this stuff coming over you with the German stuff coming the other way.
The noise rose to a crescendo such as I'd never heard before.
You wouldn't hear a word.
The shells were passing over you probably three foot, four foot, and the air, it was an inferno and your mind was another inferno.
Reason was completely blast out of it.
The bombardment created a sort of hysterical feeling.
All of a sudden, one of our fellas started crying, screaming and crying.
The officer in charge, telling the sergeant, it's difficult to explain the reaction of a man when he's in a bombardment.
He thought that this man's screaming and crying would be a danger to the rest of the men.
As soon as it was light, we were given a ration of rum, any amount of it, as much as you could drink.
And we got the order to fix bayonets.
- Fix bayonets! - Bayonets fixed!
It was a beautiful day the way it dawned after a rainy night.
A beautiful day.
Then, five minutes to go, I remember those lads standing there.
Dead silent, couldn't make a noise.
I was more frightened sitting waiting to start.
I was very frightened then. Very frightened indeed.
And an officer shouted along the line, "is everybody ready?"
And I called out, "I can't get my bayonet on my rifle, sir!"
He said, "Damn you, mate!Hurry up!"' I sent back a message to brigade headquarters to say we were all ready, but, unfortunately, a slight mistake occurred.
The first thing they knew was this terrific tremor in the ground.
We blew a mine which should've been under the German trenches, but wasn't.
It was in no-man's-land and that gave the Germans five minutes to occupy the crater, which they did.
Sergeant Moore, he was standing behind the trench.
He'd got a revolver in his hand, he said, "Anybody going back, I'll shoot him!"
So that, if we didn't go one way, we wouldn't go the other.
There wasn't a reluctance to go over the top, not with people I was with.
Fire!
- Fire! - They put a curtain of shells over you and you advance.
That was the theory of the thing. - Fire!
- Fire! -I realised that this was the moment of the assault.
To the left were the London Scottish running forward.
'I gave the order of, "Up the ladders! Over the top!"' And after this, we lived in a world of noise.
Simply noise for hours.
As soon as you get over the top, fear has left you.
We didn't run. There was no shouting, nor cheering.
Everybody was deadly quiet.
Just as I stepped into no-man's-land, somebody was shot through the head and his skull was splintered.
It wasn't a good send-off, I can assure you.
The barrage proceeded into the enemy lines in steps of 100 yards at a time.Fire!
The line of British troops, fixed bayonets, walking quite steadily behind the barrage.
It was a sight I shall never forget.
To start with, we'd had the odd machine-gun firing, but remarkably little, and it seemed almost too good to be true.
And we then realised the Germans had been retaining their fire until they saw how far the attack was developing.
Unknown to us, there was ten to 20 German machine guns.
Then all hell broke loose.
My God, he really opened up and he let us have it.
It just swept us.' Keep back! Keep back!
Keep moving, laddie!
Machine-gun bullets came at us like hailstones.
I didn't realise that the swish-swish were bullets.
I looked round and people were dropping all round you.
I mean, they just faded away, you know, on either side of you.
And I thought, "What are they shooting at me for?"
I hadn't gone more than a few yards before I was shot in the thigh.
There was a captain alongside me with his revolver out and, all of a sudden, he dropped.
And then another chap, he was hit in the leg, but he continued with great bounds, hopping on one leg.
When the bullets hit the tank, the metal flakes were whirring around like razor blades inside the tank.
You could see men dropping, but you didn't take any notice.
If you didn't get hit, you just carried on.
I found myself with a terrible pain in my left hand as if somebody had caned me and I found a big hole in it.
A man was running across the front of me and he was shot through the body because the contents of his wallet were flung out forward of me.
I felt a terrific pain in my right arm and the blood started running off the end of my hand.
I just didn't think that this German machine-gunner would trouble to fire at me but, the next thing, I felt a shock of quite a number of bullets hitting the right side of my body.
A hare crossed my path with eyes bulging, in fear, but I felt that it couldn't have been half as frightened as I was.
You could see your mates going down right and left.
You were face-to-face with the stark realisation that this is the end of it.
The two in front of me went down, wounded in the head and chest.
These bloody bullets got me in the leg and blew a great big hole at the back.
It didn't hurt.
Life was very, very hazardous indeed and we proceeded in this fashion, some getting hit and others carrying along.
You hadn't got time to deliberate upon things.
Machine-gun bullets might be coming over, but they weren't hitting you, and you just go on.
They say your past comes up when you think you were gonna die, but I hadn't got very much past at 19.
When I saw these bullets coming along, all I thought was, "Am I gonna live?"
Of course, if the thing hits you fair and square and you die immediately, you don't feel anything at all, nothing to it.
The first wave were all absolutely wiped out.
Everybody was either killed or wounded.
There were so many dead laying about, it was hard to avoid treading on them.
I was trying to step over them. The sergeant behind me said, "Go on! You mustn't take any notice of that. You keep going!"
And we were literally walking over the dead bodies of our cobbers.
The carnage is just indescribable.
I had in my path about 2,000 dead, British and German.
An attempt to clear any dead man from our path was impossible because of the shelling and we ploughed over the lot.
Any shell bursting within a few yards of the tank seemed to lift it up in the air and you felt a tremendous back pressure.
The noise of the battle when you're out in the middle of it is so terrific that you don't hear any individual shots even.
We had to stop in front of the German wire.
It was quite impossible to advance any further because of the barbed wire and the machine-gun posts, which were about 50 yards further on.
The wire in front of us was quite uncut, despite the intense bombardments.
You couldn't see anything but this wire, it seemed to be acres and acres of it.
It was just black with rust and I don't think a rabbit could have got through it.
Then, our own artillery started dropping shells amongst us.
Obviously, they hadn't got the range, or they didn't know where we were.
I heard the first shrapnel shell burst above my head.
There was a terrific whiz.
That was the disappearance of my steel helmet.
I never found it again.
I got a bit off the cheek of my backside, a piece in my hip, a piece in my leg, and a piece right through my leg.
The fellow to my left took the full blast of the shell and had half his head blown away.
Bullets were catching us and shrapnel was coming down overhead and we had all the German artillery banging away at us and our own artillery going over.
The shells were exploding all round you and it was a real, good, old battle and it got hold of you, sort of.
One had no sanity at all because the inferno was so blasting that you had no time to think.
That din, that numbing din seemed to stop one doing the things that one would normally do, no matter how well-intentioned one was.
You don't look, you see.
You don't hear, you listen.
You taste the top of your mouth.
Your nose is filled with fumes and death.
The veneer of civilisation has dropped away.
I was literally blown about 12 or 14 yards and all that I could hear was the cries and screams from the survivors, sometimes in two, sometimes in three parts.
Legs, arms, all strewn over the place and that arid smell of explosion.
All my romantic ideas of war completely vanished.
A shell had hit this man, it knocked off his left arm, knocked off his left leg, his left eye was hanging on his cheek and he's calling out for Nanny.
His bleeding eye was hanging on, pulsing.
So I shot him.
I had to. I had to shoot him.
He'd have died in any case and it put him out of his misery.
And that hurt me.
I knew there was no hope of getting any orders because there was nobody to give any.
All officers were killed and wounded and most of the NCOs.
I jumped into this big shell hole.
You dropped down anywhere, shell holes, anywhere at all just to take cover until the barrage lifted.
I'm not one of those heroes who want to take the German Army on my own, so I went to earth and I got down behind the lip of a big shell hole.
Fortunately, I was able to drop into a shell hole.
We used to call them shell-hole droppers, they would drop down into a shell hole because of the barrage and seeing a few of the men killed.
It's a pity they didn't all drop into shell holes.
Before the barrage lifted, they were dead.
The bullets were hitting the back of the shell hole where I was.
It was raining bullets. I don't know how I got missed.
From behind the lip of this shell hole, the dirt was spraying down the back of my neck.
There were three chaps in the shell hole and one of them said, they're firing at your bloody shovel!
We looked round to see a bullet go right through his head.
So that was the end of that.A sergeant came down into the shell hole on top of us, he was dead, he'd got it through the neck.
Anyway, he had a lovely pair of field glasses round his neck and I nabbed them, because things were so scarce, if there was anything like that, you'd collar it.
Jerry slapped shell after shell into us until one shell penetrated the forward part of the tank.
What happened then, I cannot tell you, but I believe there was an explosion.
We were fully-trained soldiers, we always had the rifles loaded, but we stuck in the extra five rounds to make it a ten for rapid-fire.
The Germans got up in their own trenches and fired at us.
In my opinion, they were very brave, very brave men indeed.
There was a German standing up on his parapet and flinging bombs, so I shot him.
The officer gave us orders, open immediate rapid-fire!
We all opened up as fast as we could go, continually firing.
It was a real mad minute, I'll tell you.
They stood up and I was picking the Germans off because I was a sniper.
I was trying to pick the shot and something hit me between the eyes like a Sledgehammer.
I dissolved into unconsciousness with no pain, but with millions of golden stars in a dark-blue heaven.
After I'd used up a whole lot of bullets, I got down, I say you have a go, Bill.
He didn't even fire a shot, he was killed immediately.
That's how things were.
You felt grief, it was a pal of yours, but you took it casually because I suppose you become battle-hardened.
We kept up rapid-fire there as long as our rifles would work.
They got too hot to fire any more.Fat was pouring out the woodwork of the rifles.
The muzzles were beginning to extend.
Then we got an order from the captain.
We must make a barricade of the dead the German dead and our own dead.
My captain, at that time, was anxious to go on and keep it up, but I'm afraid he died.
I had three men loading up rifle grenades and I peppered the whole line.
Judging by the shouts and the screams, I'd taken a very good toll.
There was a machine gun spraying on the lip of our shell hole.
I waited until the belt of that gun had fired and immediately carried on the advance.
The sergeant, he says,follow me.
I had managed to crawl under the wire, a lot of us got through in that way, and gathered together on the German side of the wire.
All the shells screamed over our heads onto the German posts and stopped.
Come on, lads, give them hell!
We just got up and rushed forward.
In the bayonet charge, the majority of us always had a round up the spout, besides the magazine.
There was an exultation that with a rifle, bayonet and Mills bombs, we were going to be able to get stuck into the bastards that had been killing our mates.And we went like hell, straight into the Germans.
We fired at anything that moved.
I dropped down to my knees and the sergeant fired over my shoulder and hit the German.
He was on the ground but still firing, so he went up and killed him.
There was only one method of bayonet fighting to shove your bayonet in as hard as you could.
There was this German on the floor of the trench, the poor bugger was dead scared.
While I'm wondering whether to stick him or shoot him, a German jumped out away to my left, another one on the right, so I pinned this German down, then shot the German on the left.
I put another one up the spout and shot the German running on the right.
Quite a number of Germans came in a rush and we shot them, one by one.
We probably killed the lot.
Some chap said, poor old dick got it, and I looked around and saw him lying with the top of his head off.
On our right flank came a German with a canister on his back, squirting this liquid fire out of the hose.
I looked towards jets of flame coming across the trench.
We'd never heard of flame-throwers.
Burnt 23 of our chaps to death.
I plonked one into his chest, but we didn't stop him, he must have had an armour-plated waistcoat on.
I got a bang in the arm and found I was bleeding.
I could bomb pretty well with my left arm as I could with my right.
Somebody threw a Mills bomb and it burst behind him.
He wasn't armour-plated behind, he went down.
One German came running out of this trench, screaming his head off, he nearly knocked me over.
Three Germans came out with their hands up and they were young chaps about our own age, about 19 or 20.
If Jerries came up with their hands up, we just waved them on, we didn't fire at them, obviously.
Prisoners were a nuisance!
We were shooing them back get rid of them.
The only Germans we were really fighting were the machine-gunners.
They were firing belt after belt at us and they never stopped firing.
The bloody cartridge cases were piled up in a heap.
They'd got all their best men on machine guns and they fought to their deaths.
It popped open, there was three Jerries there in front of the machine gun and the bloody gun was pointing at me, and I just swung the Lewis gun and I opened fire first.
It was split-second stuff.
Thankfully, I moved on.
As the war progressed, it was inevitable that we developed the animal characteristic of killing.
We'd got some young Lincolnshire lads, the 18-year-olds.
Machine-gunners were putting their hands up.
It didn't make a difference. They were killed.
I'm afraid there was a little bit of slaughter going on, until we got in some sort of order.
Everybody was screaming, laying down, moaning and groaning and eventually there was silence.
I found a German officer with his lung hanging out.
He was still alive, but he wasn't conscious.
You could see his lung was expanding and contracting as he was breathing.
It was the nearest I came to ever shooting a man point-blank, but we had to go on.
One dead German leaning against a shell wall.
He was a handsome bloke, he reminded me of my father.
A shell had dissected him nicely and it had taken the whole of the front of his chest down to his stomach, neatly cut aside.
What a fantastic exhibition of anatomy.
The real shooting was over in about ten minutes.
There was about 100 of us coming out, instead of 600 who'd gone over, and a band came to meet us.
It was a wonderful feeling.
I've been in a battle! And I'm so very proud about it.
Hang on!
- You got it? - Yeah.
If you'd anybody wounded or killed, if you didn't get 'em out straightaway, they went down in the soil and disappeared, it was so bad.
That's it.
You had to ascertain whether a man was alive or not.
If he was dead, then he was no trouble, medically.
Buzzing I can't put that any clearer.
Keep him level!
Give us some room!
I felt some pain, I suppose, about an hour later.
I'd got these thigh boots on and the bullet had gone in sideways, and hit the ankle bone and turned upside-down.
All right, sir? - Oh, God!
The sergeant major brought me a dixie of hot tea, which was just what I needed, it went down beautifully.
And casualties started coming back, walking casualties, men with their arms smashed up, legs trawling, and they got back to different dressing stations the best way they could.
The walking wounded, they were coming down in droves.
Some were holding one another, some were walking on their own, a light wound in the hand or arm, some were hobbling along, some were looking quite cheerful as they'd been free of something.
Hello, Mum!
My officer had said, "are you all right, Kane?"
And I said sir, I can still walk.
He said but you've been hit in the back of the head, and he handed me quite a dose of rum.
I got a whack on the tin pot. I thought my head were coming off.
The worst cases were those who were shot through the chest.
The difficulty of breathing, you see, you only had field dressings, which every man carried.
Yeah, we'll have a better look at it. - Who's waiting, boys?
You got a bottle of iodine and they'd tip it in the hole.
The pain was terrific.
Well done.
How about that for luck?
They shot right through it.
I was not in very good shape at all, and I was getting somewhere near the end of my tether.
I don't think I could go on much longer.
Every soldier, I suppose, had this breaking strain.
The medics will be waiting for you.
Well done, lads. Well done.
That's it.
We had some remarkable doctors who worked day and night in various stations on the British front looking after the wounded.
Nice cup of Rosie Lee. You all right, Jack?
They seemed never to need any sleep so, what they hadn't got in numbers, they made up in effort.
We need a shell dressing.
Both my officers, all my sergeants and three-quarters of my men were killed or wounded.
- Blighty wound. -Their ranks were made up with lads of 18 from England who'd been pushed out of factories.
Easy. That's it.
Bloody birds! Get off!
My mob were helping the battalion to bury these, only little kids, they were, 17 or 18 years of age.
In sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our Lord Jesus Christ.
A lot of those kids, that was their first action and they never knew any more. Bring them over there!
So we'd wrapped them up in blankets, dug a little shallow grave and put them in there.
I was putting a dressing on a German, and he was very shaky and fearful of what we were going to do to him.
But they were more frightened than we were and we were frightened, I don't mind telling you.
Mostly, they were just boys, as we were.
They seemed glad to be captured, they were out of it.
Is this yours? Mine.
This is his. it's yours.
Put it in your pocket.
There was a little German fella.
I gave him a cigarette and he was terrified, and I was very sorry for him, really.
He was only about 16.
And we had a chinwag and I just took his pocket watch.
It was a normal thing. We used to rob them.
Right, let's go. Pick him up!
Yes, they were underfed and they were in very poor shape.
Come on lads. Pick him up. Come on!
Funnily enough, five or six German prisoners came along and they helped carry me and I got another six watches because I robbed these fellas who helped me down.
Every time we captured prisoners, a number of German prisoners would immediately take up stretcher duty.
Now, I'm sure the Geneva Convention never required them to do that.
There you go, lads. I've got him. Steady.
Feet up. You're all right, chum. That's it.
Come. Keep going.
I took about a dozen prisoners back with me, who were all unarmed and I just had my old gun.
In some cases, there were a whole lot of Germans without even a Tommy with them.
They were really cowed they were, yes, they were very subdued.
Come along now!
I slept next to a German man who'd been wounded in the arm, to my amazement, he started talking to me in English.
And he said he'd been a waiter at the Savoy.
I mean, I don't think the average British soldier ever had any deep feelings regarding revenge against a German.
He admired him and respected him.
Go on, show him.
As the war went on, I felt as much sympathy for them as I did for myself.
The German, I always thought, was a good fighter.
I'd sooner have him on my side than on the opposite side.
Some of the Germans thought we ought to be fighting with them against the French and Russians, but none of them thought we ought to be fighting each other.
Keep on moving forward! You see, the German had been an unknown horde with their coal-scuttle helmets, and then we met them.
The German soldier, he was a very nice fella as a rule.
I think he was really a barber or a shopkeeper or something and, the same as us, he was stuck in uniform.
You're too tall. Get you next time!
We got on very well together, actually, and they used to mix in with us.
Want your hat back? Give it him back!
What do you think? They were decent sort of family people and thought a great deal of their children.
Let's try yours.
They didn't seem to bear any malice against us.
They'd had to do what they were told, like us.
Go on, go on tracking.
I couldn't speak German, but some could and the Germans, some of them could speak English.
Anyhow, we could understand each other.
The general agreement when we were talking to Germans was how useless war was and why did it have to happen?
Taking our photos.Hey! Here!
When you're passing bodies all day long, it's bound to have an effect on whoever it is, isn't it?
This big, fat German was lying in a street, his stomach was all gassed up.
His intestines were lying out on his belly and somebody had stuck a pipe in his mouth!
We all told him to get up!
Jerries come through this way.
German troops were very brave and very stubborn.
The Germans fought rearguard actions almost back to the Rhine and regiment after regiment was smashed up and cut about.
We had an idea that they were beginning to crack.
I'd say that they were, if anything, rather despondent.
They knew they had lost the war.
We, as front-line soldiers, knew they were giving up.
Quite frankly, the Germans were fed up with the whole thing.
And, gradually, that is how the war itself came to an end.
I got the impression that most of the German soldiers couldn't care less who won, as long as the war finished.
Of course, that's what everybody was thinking about then. We'd had enough.
And after a time, perhaps, nobody cared.
All right, boys, here it comes.
We're in the pictures! Shush.
There was a fella in the war called Rumour, he knows everything and Mr Rumour told us that the Germans were also negotiating for an armistice.
There was a huge poster.
All hostilities will cease on the Western Front at 11 o'clock on 11th November, 1918.
So we said to each other,what day is it?
And somebody discovered it was November 11th!
Smile for the camera!
Then we had to shine our boots and clean our buttons.
We knew the war was over then and we were quite confident that we would be there when it ended.
This proclamation was read out, stating that the hostilities would cease from 11 that morning, and actually there wasn't a cheer of any kind raised when that was read out.
At 11 o'clock, the noise of the gunfire just rolled away, like a peal of thunder in the distance.
Never heard it being quiet. Now it was dead silent.
You were so dazed that you could stand up straight and not be shot.
It was eerie.
There was a feeling of relief and gladness, I suppose, but no celebration.
The staff officer shut his watch up and said, I wonder what we're all going to do next.
There was no demonstration of any kind, nobody said a word, everybody just slumped away.
The only way we could have celebrated as regards to a liquid would have been tea, that's all.
It was one of the flattest moments of our lives.
We just couldn't comprehend it.
We had that sort of feeling as though we'd been kicked out of a job.
To some of us, it was practically the only life we'd known.
What was one going to do next?
It was just like being made redundant.
That was very much the feeling of everyone.
We were thoroughly upset, we'd all got no work to go to.
I don't want to go back.
There was no cheering, no singing, we were drained of all emotion.
We were too far gone, too exhausted to enjoy it.
All things come to an end and even a drama can go on too long.
It didn't end with a whimper, but something very much like one.
I was very happy to leave.
I'd had enough.
After a time, it begins to wear on one.
Thank goodness the bloody thing is over, that was all.
As far as I was concerned, I was out of it and now the next step in life.
The first thing we did was write home, say we were all right, making sure we got the date on the envelope right.
To someone like myself, who was interested in nature, after the horrors that man had made of the battlefront, I was immensely delighted to find shell holes in which I picked lilies of the valley and larkspur.
And I pursued Camberwell Beauties and swallowtail butterflies along the banks of the Aisne River.
We went to Boulogne.
By the way, we came home with full pack.
The only thing we left behind was the bullets, we had to discard those, but we still kept our rifle.
We went over to Folkestone, and there were long trestle tables with very kind ladies.
They gave you a sausage roll, or a bun, and a cup of tea and that was very welcome.
We entrained to Victoria and there we broke up.
We went to the barracks and we just dumped rifles, bayonets and everything and there were a lot of suits on display, hats, shoes.
You could tell her which one you wanted, style and colour and they measured you.
I was horrified by what I saw when I came back here and when one tried to get a job.
There was mass unemployment.
I thought, "This isn't much of a life."
It was a difficult thing to realise you're of no commercial value.
It was a shame, the way ex-servicemen were treated. You weren't wanted.
Some places said, "No ex-servicemen need apply,"
and that was the sort of attitude you were up against.
One of my pals was killed and, when I went home, the first thing that I did was go to his mother, who, if she'd had a frying pan, she'd have hit me.
Her son had been killed and I'd come back alive.
She was very bitter.
The first night I came home, I got into my old bed, the first bed I'd laid in since l joined the army.
When Mother brought my cup of tea up in the morning, she found me fast asleep on the floor.
People never talked about the war.
It was a thing that had no conversational value at all.
Most people were absolutely disinterested.
When I got home, my father and my mother didn't seem least interested.
They hadn't any conception of what it was like.
And there was no reason why any one of us millions should have been favoured with a "thank you very much" for having got a little bit muddy and out of touch with good manners.
And on occasions when I did talk about it, my father would argue points of fact that he couldn't have known about, because he wasn't there.
Every soldier I've spoken to experienced the same thing.
We were a race apart from the civilians, and you could speak to your comrades, and they understood but, the civilians, it was just a waste of time.
However nice and sympathetic they were, attempts of well-meaning people to sympathise reflected the fact that they didn't really understand at all.
I think the magnitude was just beyond their comprehension.
They didn't understand that people that you'd known and played football with were just killed beside you.
My friend who enlisted with me lay there like a sack of rags until he went black before anybody troubled to bury him.
They knew that people came back covered with mud and lice, but they'd no idea of the strain of sitting in a trench and waiting for something to drop on one's head.
You couldn't convey the awful state of things, the way you lived like animals and behaved like animals.
People didn't seem to realise what a terrible thing war was.
I think they felt that the war was one continual cavalry charge.
They hadn't any conception. And how could they?
Well, it started off in a reasonable manner, it was people fighting on horseback with swords, but it developed into something ghastly.
People don't realise the potential of military equipment.
A man's life wasn't worth anything at the end of the war.
We were none of us heroes.
We didn't like this business of being killed at all.
When we were talking among ourselves, we used to say, "Christ! They won't have any more wars like this!"
How did we endure it? The answer must be partly the fear of fear, the fear of being found afraid.
Another is belief in human beings, your colleague, and there's no letting him down.
There may be right on both sides, but I think war is horrible.
Everything should be done to avoid war.
I still can't see the justification for it.
It was all really rather horrible.
I think history will decide, in the end, that it was not worthwhile.
The only thing that really did annoy me was, when I went back to work after I'd got demobilised, I went down the stores, and the bloke behind the counter was a bloke who I knew.
He said, "Where have you been? On nights?"
Two million years ago, and our planet is a very different place.
A saber-toothed cat, the Smilodon.
A fearsome predator of its age.
Standing in the way, a giant terror bird, two meters tall.
Both sides are armed and prepared for a fight.
This is the story of the great battles for survival and the dynasties that would take over the world.
This is the story of life.
If you know where to look, you can still find clues to the origins of life on our planet.
This is not just a gathering of marine predators.
It is a coming together of ancient bloodlines.
Sharks, living fossils, virtually unchanged for hundreds of millions of years.
Dolphins, air-breathing mammals whose ancestors once roamed on land.
Whales, bigger than any other animals that have ever lived.
Birds, the last survivors of the dinosaurs, the world's greatest dynasty.
All predators, all hunting the same prey, but all with totally different origins.
There are more than ten million species of plant and animals alive today.
And yet, they are just 1% of all species that have ever existed.
By traveling back in time, we'll meet many of the 99% that have gone extinct to reveal the most extraordinary story of all, the story of life on our planet.
Life and all its incredible variety had to start somewhere.
The first spark appeared four billion years ago.
Perhaps uniquely, our planet had just the right conditions.
Liquid water, energy from the Sun, and the perfect chemistry for life to take hold.
The exact process is lost in the mists of time.
But what it produced was a tiny single living cell.
the Last Universal Common Ancestor from which all life, everything, is descended.
From these humble beginnings, life took billions more years to develop real complexity.
A feat it first achieved in the oceans.
The earliest animals to attain supremacy were simple life forms.
These invertebrates, animals without backbones, ruled the seas for many millions of years.
Throughout history, life has been waging an unending war.
One dynasty rising, only to be vanquished by the next.
Plants were among the first to conquer the land creating conditions that, in time, allowed the invertebrates to follow and take over.
But the invertebrates could not rule forever.
A new dynasty would surpass them.
One that also came from the water.
The amphibians whose novel body plan of four limbs and a backbone would prove an enduring blueprint for success.
Their reach was limited by their ties to water.
But they spawned another dynasty with no such binds.
The reptiles.
Able to exploit even the driest regions, their sprawling gait carried them around the world.
For the first time in history, there was a global power.
From these early reptiles came the most iconic dynasty of them all.
The dinosaurs.
They were to rule for over 150 million years.
A group of astonishing variety, whose absolute dominion was only cut short by calamitous bad luck.
Out of their shadows rose the last great bloodline.
The mammals.
One of whom would go on to change our planet like nothing before.
The rise and fall of these dynasties, over four billion years, has not just been a matter of chance.
The whole journey, from the beginning of life to the infinite variety we know today, has been driven by certain fundamental principles.
The rules of life.
The first rule is the best adapted will always win through.
Every one of these butterfly eggs looks identical.
But each has a different combination of genes that makes them, individually, completely unique.
Some will have genetic qualities that help them survive.
Qualities that will pass from generation to generation until eventually, one will be so different to its predecessors that it becomes an entirely new species, better adapted to its environment.
This is evolution.
But the caterpillars aren't the only ones evolving.
Everything in this forest is fighting for survival including the plants.
Unchecked, the caterpillars would strip them bare.
But this plant has evolved its own adaptations for survival.
Poison in its leaves, capable of killing anything that eats them.
It's chemical warfare.
Then a new species of caterpillar evolves that can eat the otherwise poisonous leaves, along with any eggs that might be on them.
In response, other butterflies adapt to only lay on plants that are free of eggs ensuring their young have the best possible start.
But the plants retaliate forming growths on their leaves that mimic butterfly eggs deterring any females from laying there.
What's more, the fake eggs produce a sweet nectar that attracts ants that feed on caterpillars.
The first rule of life, that the best adapted will win through has produced the huge diversity that exists today.
The next rule of life is that competition drives adaptation.
And the most acute competition comes from one's own kind.
A male terror bird.
His territory is the lakeshore.
But he's not alone.
A younger male wants this prime spot.
The older one can't ignore the threat.
The youngster refuses to back down.
He needs a territory of his own.
The two begin a ritual display.
Assessing the other's strength while showing off their own.
Their coordinated moves as formal as a dance.
Who will be the first to back down?
Or attack?
With nothing to separate them, a fight is inevitable.
But they have company.
The Smilodon's mammalian cunning was one reason terror birds went extinct.
Competition, both within and between species, has always driven evolution.
But it's not just those doing battle that are always changing.
So too is the battlefield itself, which leads to the third rule of life.
Earth never remains stable for long.
Sometimes that helps life.
Sometimes it hinders it.
Throughout history, volcanoes have been one of the greatest agents of change.
Eruptions lasting thousands of years have repeatedly engulfed vast swathes of our planet.
Pumping gases into the atmosphere, changing the climate, and, at worst causing global mass extinction.
The world has rarely been stable.
At times, a realm of fire.
At times, a realm of ice.
Our changing planet has created so many challenges for life.
From toxic seas to global wastelands and periods of almost endless rain.
At four different times, the planet has pushed life to the very edge of existence.
Each time, more than three-quarters of all species were lost in mass extinctions.
Ours can be a brutal planet.
But there was one period when Earth was stable for 100 million years.
A period which allowed one group to become the mightiest of dynasties.
This was the age of dinosaurs.
The long calm helped dinosaurs to proliferate in huge numbers.
These are Maiasaura, gentle plant eaters that form herds many thousands strong.
This mass gathering provides safety, and not just for the adults.
This rather cautious female is keen to get back to her nest.
Maiasaura means "good mother."
Like the other females, she has made her nest in an enormous colony.
To reach it, she must run the gauntlet of defensive mothers keen to protect their young.
In avoiding one aggressor, she strays too close to the next.
At last, she reaches her own nest.
She feeds her young in a very bird-like way.
She'll protect them in the nest for many months, until they are big enough to join the rest of the herd.
Yet the planet didn't just support large numbers of dinosaurs, its stability also supported dinosaurs of every shape and size.
Triceratops is very different to the defenseless Maiasaura.
Weighing five tons and boasting three horns, she is heavily armored adapted to a world where the best form of defense is attack.
With the breeding season imminent, she needs to be in peak condition.
And that means finding the best food wherever she can.
But her search has taken her far from the herd and closer to the edge of the forest.
She's right to be nervous.
Triceratops aren't the only giants in these woods.
Tyrannosaurus rex.
The ultimate predator.
She has her two youngsters with her.
The siblings are faster than their mother.
They work as a team.
The Triceratops can hold off the youngsters, but not the adult.
Only the protection of the herd can save her.
They form a defensive wall.
Even the world's greatest predator knows when she's beaten.
Unlike the young male.
Dinosaurs might still rule today if conditions on Earth had remained the same.
But everything was about to change, and in just one day.
An asteroid the size of Mount Everest, traveling 20 times faster than a bullet, smashed into the planet.
It blew a hole 20 kilometers deep and 180 wide setting off an earth-shattering chain of events.
Rising from the massive crater came the real killer.
A wall of ash and debris hundreds of kilometers thick that enveloped the globe.
The cloud blocked out the sunlight, leading to the death of almost all dinosaurs and three-quarters of life on Earth.
The annihilation was global.
It was the world's fifth mass extinction.
But there were survivors.
Survivors that would form the basis of all species that exist today.
The birds were the only remaining dinosaurs.
Today, they number more than 10,000 species occupying every habitat on Earth.
But the birds didn't have the planet to themselves.
Another great dynasty also rose from the ashes.
The mammals.
Under the dinosaurs, they had been a mere footnote in history.
Without the asteroid strike, none of these survivors would have had a chance to rule.
From the cataclysm of the mass extinction came this new multitude of life in all its wondrous variety all perfectly adapted to the challenges of life.
The struggle to protect and raise one's young, to find food, and to breed.
The cast of characters may have changed, but the essentials remain the same.
Water and the energy from the Sun continue to support life, just as they have for billions of years.
Even today, the rules of life still apply.
Only the best adapted will win through.
Competition drives evolution.
And a rapidly changing planet causes chaos.
These rules of life determine how dynasties will rise and how they will fall.
Every single thing alive today can trace its heritage back four billion years.
This in the face of incredible odds.
99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct.
Life today is the 1% that made it through.
This series will explore the most important milestones in the history of life.
From when mammals established themselves as a global power to the ancestors of the birds first taking to the air to the evolution of hard-shelled eggs that led to the rise of the mighty dinosaurs.
And even the moment when animals first came out of the water.
In the next chapter, we go back to life's origins in the sea and the very first fights for survival on our extraordinary planet.
For billions of years, much of our world was fiercely inhospitable ravaged by the elements and the forces of nature.
But this is the story of what was happening beneath the waves.
Here, shielded from the storms, life had taken hold and was about to change our planet forever.
Far back in the depths of time, Earth looked nothing like the world we know today.
Nearly 90% of its surface was water, yet this was no blue planet.
Instead, vast clouds of methane had turned the atmosphere yellow.
On land, conditions were even worse.
Volcanoes had been erupting for millions of years.
Their explosive power, one of the few sounds in this otherwise silent realm.
With the world made up of nothing but toxic air and rivers of molten rock life as we know it was impossible.
But out in the prehistoric seas, something is stirring.
Beneath the surface hangs a great swathe of plankton.
Microscopic cells like these have just evolved something new, photosynthesis.
This means they can harness the sun's energy to grow, a breakthrough so important that plankton will one day give rise to every single plant on Earth.
But that's not all.
One byproduct of photosynthesis is a gas, the missing ingredient for animal life to exist oxygen.
For nearly two billion years, plankton produced so much oxygen that it transformed our planet.
No longer hostile, Earth became a new world, where life could finally run wild.
Today, millions of years later, it's still possible to get a glimpse of what that next wave of life was like.
Because in some parts of our shallow seas life still resembles that more primitive time.
They may not look like it but these are animals very similar to the first complex life forms.
Most are soft-bodied and rooted to the seafloor.
All have senses.
And some can even see their surroundings.
Many get their food by filter-feeding, picking out plankton, sometimes in the most curious of ways.
But not all animals here are stuck in one place.
Some can move, exploring the seafloor like their pioneering relatives millions of years ago.
It may seem like these shallows are a kind of Eden, a safe haven for life.
But this is no paradise.
Living off modern-day California this is a rainbow nudibranch.
And its sluggish nature hides a sinister side because, like its ancestors, it's here to hunt.
It's adapted to a life of predation.
And its prey of choice, anemones.
But like the very first predators, the nudibranch has room for improvement because here, timing is everything.
Luckily for the hunter, its prey is anchored to the seafloor and can't hide forever.
The anemone's fate?
To be eaten from the inside out.
The arrival of predation was a seismic shift in the ancient seas.
The hunted had to adapt or risk extinction.
And one group adapted in a way never seen before.
Despite being single animals, they were able to separate into layers of individuals, that then broke free.
Jellyfish.
530 million years ago, they were the very first animals to escape the seafloor and swim.
But predators were already everywhere.
Armed with venomous harpoons, these anemones make quick work of baby jellyfish.
And they are so abundant escape seems impossible.
Caught.
But not for long.
Free at last.
Thanks to their ability to swim, jellyfish were the first to venture out of the shallows and into the big blue.
Here, with fish yet to evolve, jellyfish were entirely free of predation.
In time, others would follow.
But more than half a billion years ago, the open ocean belonged to them.
For those still stuck on the seabed, escaping predation required a different approach.
This curious creature is a trilobite.
And its breakthrough adaptation, armor.
Trilobites are one of the first in a brand-new dynasty, the arthropods.
They've evolved an external skeleton, a shield-like shell that protects their soft insides.
And in these waters, they need it.
This is Anomalocaris.
A bizarre-looking animal, its name translates as "the abnormal shrimp."
And in the tropical shallows 508 million years ago, it's the world's first apex predator.
Despite the trilobite's armor, it makes sense to keep out of sight.
But away from the canyons, there's nowhere to hide because what makes this hunter so special is its speed.
Unlike jellyfish, Anomalocaris can swim with both direction and pace.
But that isn't always enough because when cornered, the trilobite's armor comes into its own.
Rolling into a ball, it becomes completely impenetrable.
Even for the abnormal shrimp.
With the coast clear, the trilobite continues on its merry way once more.
It's searching for one of the ancient ocean's greatest sights the trilobite mating grounds, where thousands come together to breed.
In the story of life, armor has been such a success that today, nearly 80% of all animals, including insects, spiders, and crabs, are related to this ancient arthropod.
But armor couldn't protect them from everything.
Forty million years later, and a new era of life has begun, with more diversity than ever before.
Here, trilobites are still in their prime, but their armor is even more robust because on this reef, danger comes from a new type of predator.
Ancestors of today's octopus and squid, these tentacled giants are part of a dynasty known as the cephalopods.
The largest, with a shell eight meters long, are Cameroceras.
The trilobite is dwarfed by this towering hunter.
But it's not their size that makes them such a threat.
Cameroceras have evolved a new way to catch their prey even when they can't see it.
Because in these waters, they hunt using not just sight, but touch.
All the trilobite can do is try to stay out of reach.
With a scissor-like beak able to slice through the toughest armor, Cameroceras dominate these seas.
Although, there is another important new arrival.
Graced with a look of permanent surprise, this is Arandaspis an early kind of fish.
It hasn't yet evolved a jaw, so can only suck up the scraps.
But what it has evolved will change the course of history.
It has a new internal skeleton that makes it both fast and agile.
A backbone.
And while it may not look like much, fish like Arandaspis will one day give rise to all other vertebrates.
Amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds.
But for now, vertebrates are only at the beginning of a very, very long journey.
Twenty million years later, life faced one of its greatest challenges as the climate suddenly began to cool a development that was to have dire consequences.
Little by little, the sea started to freeze.
For the inhabitants of Earth's once tropical waters, this was a catastrophe.
The shallow seas became a frozen graveyard.
The world's first mass extinction.
The fatal freeze was caused by a 60% drop in carbon dioxide.
Without this greenhouse gas to warm it, the planet was plunged into an ice age.
One that would last for 200,000 years.
At its peak, almost half the world was covered in ice, causing the demise of 85% of all life, lost from our family tree forever.
With the tropical shallows gone, the few survivors were those who could head to deeper waters.
Animals like the nautilus, a smaller relative of the giant Cameroceras.
It first evolved hundreds of millions of years ago, but still exists today.
It owes its success to the deep ocean's unchanging nature.
Below 600 meters, the temperature rarely fluctuates, making it a sanctuary of stability.
When the Ice Age struck, all kinds of animals headed into the abyss.
But it's the cephalopods who have thrived.
Today, many still haunt the deep sea including octopus and squid.
Their gelatinous bodies are unaffected by the deep's immense pressure.
And super senses let them find their way in the dark.
No longer constrained by shells, they've evolved into almost every size and shape.
But this pitch-black world isn't theirs alone.
Arthropods, like this spider crab, live here too feeling their way across the ocean floor.
Alongside them, the vertebrates.
With little food on offer, down here, they're rare.
Only around 10% of all fish today live in the deep.
This is not a place they excel unlike the cephalopods, who have become the deep's near-perfect predators.
Something this shrimp may soon discover.
All around it, the water twinkles with bioluminescent plankton.
Any disturbance, and for the briefest of moments, they light up.
But the shrimp has company.
A half-concealed squid is watching the show.
Its large eyes allow it to see exceptionally well in the dark.
Picking out the dots of light, it can follow every move the shrimp makes.
All it needs is the right moment.
The shrimp never saw it coming.
With such extraordinary senses, perhaps it's no surprise that squid have mastered this cold, dark world.
But for those who lived back in the Ice Age, things were beginning to heat up.
200,000 years after the big freeze, there appeared in the ice a vein of blue.
Water.
Carbon dioxide levels had bounced back, causing global temperatures to rise.
The great melt had begun.
Slow at first, the thaw rapidly gathered pace.
Before long, glaciers hundreds of meters tall cascaded into the warming seas.
Within a few millennia, almost half the planet's ice had melted.
Within a few more, it had entirely gone.
For those who had sought refuge in the deep, now was a chance to head back up.
Off the coast of modern-day Australia, this is a young giant cuttlefish.
Like his Ice Age ancestors, he's come to the shallows in search of a mate.
But others have got here first including an alpha male jealously protecting his chosen partner.
And he does not intend to share.
But the smaller male isn't deterred.
Instead, he bides his time and watches as a new male enters the arena and signals his intention to challenge the alpha.
With neither backing down, a fight is inevitable allowing the young male to make his move.
As he approaches, he tucks in his tentacles and changes color to perfectly mimic a female.
Using brain, not brawn, he sneaks straight in.
The alpha now thinks he's guarding not one female but two.
He's unaware that this sly young interloper is mating with his chosen partner.
Their exceptional intelligence and remarkable senses have helped cephalopods colonize every ocean on Earth.
Yet, in the shallows, they are rarely the top predators their towering ancestors once were because in the ancient seas, there was to be a changing of the guard.
Seventy million years after the great melt, in a period known as the Devonian, the vertebrates made their move.
This is Dunkleosteus a descendant of the tiny Arandaspis.
But at nine meters long, this fish is no underdog.
Even its young, barely half its size, are fearsome predators.
And this juvenile has spotted something out in the blue.
Ammonoids, close relatives of today's deep-sea nautilus.
Being a vertebrate, Dunkleosteus has the pace to catch up with them.
But the ammonoids boast a trick of their own jet propulsion.
Just what it needs to outmaneuver the young fish.
As it starts to circle the ammonoid does the same shielding its body with its shell.
Once upon a time, this defense would have worked.
But Dunkleosteus has a weapon its tiny ancestors did not.
Jaws.
It can bite down and crush its prey.
As long as it can find the right angle.
Luckily for the ammonoid, the juvenile's jaws are not yet strong enough to break its shell.
But the adult's are.
The pairing of backbones with jaws was to prove a winning combination.
So perfect that, from this moment on, the vertebrates would never look back.
Today, there are more than 30,000 species of fish.
Forty times as many as the cephalopods.
While their variety is remarkable each still has that perfect pairing.
Backbones give them speed and power no matter their size.
While jaws give them bite.
But there is more to jaws than that.
Some fish use them to protect their eggs.
Others to attract a mate.
Then there's the sarcastic fringehead.
He doesn't just use his to catch crabs.
He also uses them for one of the most intimidating displays in nature to rid his patch of rivals.
For these fish, size is everything.
Big jaws have let this fringehead rule his strip of seafloor, but they've also allowed a more infamous group of fish to rule the waves.
They first appeared more than 400 million years ago and have been feared ever since.
They are the sharks.
To the winning combination of backbone and jaws, they've added senses so sharp they can detect prey from hundreds of meters away.
With many also boasting size and strength, they are as close to perfection as an ocean predator can get.
In the sea off Western Australia, these fish are balled together for protection.
But the sharks hold back because they have a special plan of attack.
Appearing to work as a team, some of the sharks rise from below to trap the fish against the surface.
Others come in from the side, corralling the shoal away from the open ocean and into the shallows.
Now numbering in their hundreds, the sharks play for time as their prey get ever more tired.
It's a hunting technique that has been honed over millions of years.
But the carnage starts in the blink of an eye.
Virtually unchanged since the great melt, sharks are one of the most successful dynasties in history.
But they owe their rise to the fall of their greatest rivals.
Back in the ancient seas, and Dunkleosteus had reigned for 20 million years.
So vicious a predator that not even early sharks could compete.
But Dunkleosteus was to suffer from a devastating quirk of fate caused by plankton.
Billions of years earlier, plankton had been the catalyst for animal life.
But now, they would almost bring it to an end.
A sudden surge in ocean nutrients caused the population of plankton to increase on an unprecedented scale.
As it spread through the sunlit shallows, this thick soup began to rot causing the ocean's oxygen to plummet.
Without this critical ingredient for life, animals started to suffocate.
For those unable to escape the sludge, there was only one possible outcome.
Extinction.
Dunkleosteus was one of many to be lost from our planet.
Across the world, coastlines became littered with the dead.
Only the lucky few, including early sharks, were able to survive.
In all, 80% of marine life was wiped out in this, the world's second mass extinction.
And yet this is only half the story.
The nutrients that caused the plankton explosion didn't start out in the sea.
They were carried there from the land released by plants during one of the most amazing events of all time the greening of planet Earth.
What was once a volcanic wasteland was now overflowing with life.
And this new world offered opportunity.
For where plants had paved the way, animals would follow.
And before long, the race to dominate the land would begin.
Millions of years before the age of dinosaurs our planet was ruled by equally magnificent beasts.
Two great dynasties had emerged and were vying for domination.
This is the story of the battle to conquer land and how it changed everything for life on our planet.
For most of our planet's history, land has been inhospitable to life.
A bleak and desolate realm more like the surface of the moon than like Earth today.
It's hard to imagine how anything could ever make this hostile place its home.
But from beneath the waves, where life had thrived for more than a billion years, one curious life-form was among the first to rise to the challenge.
Lichen may not look remarkable, but they are in fact completely unique.
A pioneering partnership.
Neither plant nor animal, lichen are a strange combination of fungi and algae that only together had what it took to overcome the extreme hostility of barren Earth.
But they were more than just pioneering.
They were groundbreaking.
As they spread their tiny filaments helped to break down rock and produce the first ever soil paving the way for plants to take over.
Micro plants, like moss, were first to appear.
With leaves only one cell thick, they couldn't grow upwards, but could spread out.
Reproducing faster than lichen, they soon carpeted the land, which they ruled undisturbed for the next 40 million years.
But a green revolution was coming that would change the landscape forever.
Key was the evolution of a new compound, lignin.
Lignin strengthened the plants' cell walls allowing them to grow bigger and stronger than ever before.
No longer confined to carpeting the land, plants began to battle for the real estate above, fighting for access to light.
Eventually, some plants grew so tall, they towered above the world around them.
Today's redwoods are nature's skyscrapers.
Reaching heights of more than a hundred meters, they are the tallest living things to have ever existed.
But redwoods are just one of more than 400,000 species of plant, the most visible signs of life on our planet.
Back in Earth's distant past, the arrival of plants created new habitats for the next invaders from the sea.
The first animals to ever set foot on land were the arthropods.
Relatives of the trilobites, their hard exoskeletons had served as useful armor underwater.
On land, that armor supported them and prevented them from drying out.
They could also breathe through this tough exterior.
And with oxygen levels 60% higher than they are today, some grew to be giants.
Arthropleura, the largest millipede to ever walk the Earth.
At over two and a half meters long and a half meter wide, he has no natural enemies so can focus all his energy on finding a mate.
But for Arthropleura, the pursuit of the perfect partner is not straightforward.
For he's virtually blind and his world extends only as far as he can sense.
The fern forest is vast, and a female could be anywhere.
But his search isn't as hopeless as it might seem.
Females ready to mate leave scent trails for males to follow.
A lifeline in the darkness.
And yet, sensing where she once was is not the same as sensing where she is.
Finally, his chance to charm can begin.
By rubbing together parts of his shell, he creates his own unique love song.
Mating on land can be an awkward affair.
Success requires the perfect alignment.
So it's important at this critical stage not to put a foot wrong.
345 million years later, and in today's forests, the arthropod art of seduction has come a long way.
Especially for some of the less armored members of the group.
Unlike the ancient Arthropleura, male jumping spiders have superb vision and are no larger than a grain of rice.
But what they lack in stature they make up for in style.
Each species has its own signature dance move to attract female attention.
The peacock.
The side shuffle.
The disco dancer.
And the feather shake.
While the males evolved colorful costumes and intricate dance moves females developed impeccable taste.
His side shuffle has caught her attention.
But has he got the moves she's looking for?
Only the very best will do.
Waving her abdomen signals she's not impressed.
He needs to be careful, for fussy females sometimes eat their suitors.
Still it's worth one more try.
Clearly, he's not getting the message.
He may be unlucky in love, but his arthropod dynasty has had better luck.
They now make up over 80% of all animal species.
The secret to arthropod success lies in their simple segmented body plan which has evolved in countless different directions.
Some have ears in their legs.
Others, eyes on stalks.
And armor plating for battle.
Variation after variation, arthropods are evolution run wild.
Including the greatest runner of them all, the tiger beetle.
Its design has been fine-tuned over millions of years.
The latest model is built for speed.
For its size, it is one of the fastest sprinters on Earth.
If scaled up to human proportions, it would run at over 1,000 kilometers per hour.
But there is one drawback to life in the fast lane.
His brain can't keep up.
He must frequently stop to get his bearings while hunting down his next victim.
But his frantic search for food can lead him into dangerous territory because sometimes the hunter can also be the hunted.
Fast and furious is not this trapdoor spider's style.
She prefers to wait for prey to come to her.
In the battle of the arthropods, flight would often make the difference between life and death.
More than 300 million years ago, one group of arthropods were the first creatures to take to the skies.
And the evolution of wings would eventually launch them to global success.
The insects.
Today, for every human on the planet, there are more than a billion insects.
They are the most abundant group of animals on Earth.
Despite their current success, the ultimate flying insects first appeared back in the ancient swamps.
Dragonflies.
Their flight is as close to perfect as it gets.
Four flexible wings, independently controlled, give them unparalleled mobility.
They can fly in any direction, pull off the tightest turns and accelerate faster than a fighter jet.
A winning design that has remained almost the same for hundreds of millions of years.
And yet, living in the same prehistoric swamps, another group of animals were undergoing their own radical change.
Beneath the surface, vertebrates had continued to evolve and a new type of fish was thriving, the lobe-finned fish.
Some grew to be monstrous predators.
In this fish-eat-fish world, it pays to be big.
For the smaller ones, there's refuge in the shallows where their unique lobed fins are a distinct advantage.
Muscular and highly versatile, they are different to those of other fish.
Not only do they help them swim but they're strong enough to support their body weight and help them crawl out of the water.
But these fish also have another game-changing adaptation the ability to breathe air.
Not through gills but through primitive lungs.
Together, these evolutionary advances allowed vertebrates to leave the water and explore the land.
The race was on to colonize this new world.
But it was already too late for these lobe-finned fish.
Others had made this transition before them.
Like the three-meter-long Anthracosaurus that had already found its feet.
The evolution from fin to limb took millions of years.
But once completed, life on land would never be the same again.
The age of amphibians had begun.
Today, there are more than 8,000 species of amphibian.
A peculiar but diverse group of newts, frogs, salamanders, and toads.
Not quite the giants they once were, but still successful hunters with their own killer style.
Hundreds of millions of years after Anthracosaurus, swamplands remain a stronghold for amphibians.
Here in Europe's Danube delta, marsh frogs live in their thousands and have become expert insect hunters with a particular taste for dragonflies.
Thanks to their wraparound vision, catching one isn't easy.
But marsh frogs have evolved some quirky adaptations of their own.
Webbed feet help them get airborne.
And a projectile tongue gives them extraordinary reach.
Even so, dragonflies in flight can be just too hard to catch.
Waiting for the aerial acrobats to land might make things easier.
Time to take a different approach.
A female laying eggs in the water.
Half-submerged, she should be an easier target.
The dragonflies are just too fast.
And they can barrel-roll.
Missed again.
But frogs are nothing if not persistent.
Despite the low hit rate, amphibians have survived for over 350 million years.
And yet, they never conquered every environment the planet had to offer because there's something all amphibians need to raise their young.
Water.
This is the strawberry dart frog of Costa Rica.
Her tadpoles are in mortal danger.
Their tiny puddle, almost dry.
Their only means of escape is on their mother's back.
The hard part is finding water.
Luckily she knows exactly where to go.
Twenty meters above her, a bromeliad collects rainwater.
The perfect pool for her precious tadpole.
But first, she must get there one hop at a time.
Barely the size of a human thumbnail, this is her own personal Everest.
Safe at last.
No matter what great heights amphibians reached in their conquest of land they never escaped their tie to water a tie that would be their undoing when conditions on Earth radically changed.
During the period known as the Carboniferous, Earth's great land masses merged, and the supercontinent of Pangaea was born.
As the land dried, the vast swamps began to disappear.
Lacking water, most amphibians struggled.
But not all.
One evolved a revolutionary adaptation that enabled it to thrive.
Its egg developed a protective shell that held the embryo in its own private pool of fluid.
Inside, the young could develop safely without drying out.
The tie to water was finally broken by the evolution of this amniotic egg.
Known as the amniotes, these creatures could colonize the drier land in a way that amphibians could not.
And from this one common ancestor, all mammals, reptiles, birds, and dinosaurs would descend.
Sixty million years after the evolution of the amniotic egg, amniotes have spread across Pangaea producing two new dynasties and the start of an endless rivalry.
These sleeping armored beasts are a primitive type of reptile.
Scutosaurus, among the largest animals on land.
Weighing over a ton, they are the first giant plant-eaters to roam the planet.
Amniotic eggs allowed them to flourish in the drier conditions and go where others could not.
But Pangaea didn't just belong to them.
Another new bloodline had emerged.
The ancestors of the mammals.
While a Lystrosaurus is no match for a Scutosaur he has cousins here who are.
A gorgonopsid.
A more impressive forerunner to the mammals.
At over three meters long and 300 kilos, she rivals any big cat alive today.
With her powerful sense of smell, tracking her prey is easy.
Getting past their heavy armor will be her greatest challenge.
But she has a secret weapon.
Saber-like teeth.
Even so, she'll need stealth to get close.
She must choose her moment and her target carefully.
Slowly and silently does it.
The rivalry between mammals and reptiles has been a feature of life on Earth for hundreds of millions of years.
But their early rise was not to last, because in the far north of Pangaea, something catastrophic was happening.
Lying dormant for years on end, the colossal forces at work beneath Earth's surface are easily forgotten.
But the molten underworld is always stirring, always probing for weakness.
Beneath Pangaea's crust, a plume of superheated magma was working its way to the surface.
Once these Permian eruptions started there was no stopping them.
What made them unique was their monumental scale.
They were among the largest, most violent eruptions that life has ever witnessed.
And they raged for 100,000 years.
The devastation was unprecedented.
An area half the size of the United States lost to lava.
Millions of square kilometers, once so full of life, obliterated by the Earth itself.
And that was just the beginning.
The eruptions released something far more dangerous than lava.
A toxic concoction of noxious gases.
When these gases combined with water a potent cocktail of acid rain poured down.
Water, the giver of life, was now its destroyer.
The toxic rain poisoned the ground killing off the plants.
Without their roots to bind the soil together entire ecosystems were washed away.
And yet, there was something even more destructive in the air.
A silent killer.
Carbon dioxide.
The volcanoes released six times more CO2 than is in our atmosphere today triggering ten degrees of global warming and all the climate devastation that comes with it.
Hothouse Earth raged as the forces of nature ran wild.
There was nowhere to hide from the chaos.
And the oceans were worst affected.
As they warmed and acidified, oxygen levels plummeted turning the seas, where life first took hold, into a desolate graveyard.
This was the planet's third, and most devastating, mass extinction.
Ninety percent of all species lost forever.
Entire branches torn off the evolutionary tree.
But in the loss of many, endured the few.
All that remained of a bygone age.
Never had their survival been so important.
The future of all life now hung by a thread.
252 million years ago and our planet is dying.
The biggest extinction event in history has left the world barren and deathly silent.
But this is the story of the few that survived.
The start of the Triassic Period and the rivers of fire are gradually subsiding.
In their wake, cooling lava covers an area half the size of the United States in a crust up to three kilometers deep.
Volcanic gases have caused global temperatures to soar.
Forests and reefs have been annihilated.
Hundreds of millions of years of evolution, gone.
Yet here, hidden in the blackened landscape lies opportunity.
For there is one particular life-form that thrives on dead organic matter.
Fungi.
With the world an apocalyptic graveyard, fungi were in their element.
And for a few thousand years these simple organisms became the dominant life-form on Earth.
But not every survivor of the Permian extinction relied on death for their success.
One lowly creature found itself perfectly placed to take over the world.
Lystrosaurus an ancient ancestor of the mammal.
This curious, pig-sized creature was used to burrowing underground and seeking refuge in caves, a way of life that saved it when other animals were dying.
Once hapless underdogs, they are now one of the few lucky survivors of Armageddon.
With most vegetation destroyed by the extinction, finding food is hard.
But Lystrosaurus are resilient and able to forage over large areas.
They're constantly on the move, searching for roots, tubers, and small pockets of regrowth.
But they weren't the only animal survivors.
Life in many forms found a way.
Lystrosaurus's simple but adaptable lifestyle would reap astonishing rewards.
Facing little competition and no large predators, the volcanic eruptions turned it from a bottom-of-the-food-chain burrower to the animal that inherited the Earth.
In the years following the mass extinction, they made up three-quarters of all vertebrate life on land, something no other animal has ever done.
But their dominance couldn't last, for another survivor of the mass extinction was on the ascent thanks to huge changes to the very structure of our planet.
For tens of millions of years, the Earth's continents had been converging, creating a vast ocean on one side of the world and a single immense land mass on the other, the supercontinent of Pangaea.
The drying that started in a previous era is now compounded by searing heat.
Temperatures spike to 60 degrees Celsius.
Sandstorms scour the interior.
Dunes rise over a kilometer high gradually forming the largest and most hostile desert the planet has ever seen.
Yet on the margins of this barren and lifeless landscape, another group of survivors was on the rise.
And they still dominate our deserts today.
This is the Atacama in South America.
It's been a desert here since the Triassic Period.
Some parts have gone decades without a drop of rain, yet one type of animal thrives here.
Lizards.
They're reptiles, supremely adapted to this dry environment.
They have tough, scaly skin so they don't shrivel in the baking sun.
Instead, the sun fuels them heating their cold blood so they can reach racing speeds.
But even desert reptiles need to quench their thirst.
Water seeping up through the ground.
Unfortunately, these water holes are almost as salty as the Dead Sea.
Drinking this would be a death sentence so these lizards get their water from an unexpected source, an animal whose ancestors also survived Armageddon.
Insects were hit hard in the mass extinction, but some made it through.
Today, these brine flies are salt specialists, desalinating the water, and in the process, making themselves into perfect little water bottles for lizards.
The challenge is catching them.
But just when it thinks it's cracked it, trouble on the horizon.
These prime fly-catching spots are in high demand and the locals do not like to share.
A stalemate, but on another lizard's territory.
The thirsty lizard seizes the moment making the most of their distraction no matter how brief.
The ultimate desert dwellers, lizards are tough and resilient, just like their ancient ancestors.
But back in the Triassic, it was much larger reptiles who would change the course of history.
In the four million years since the Permian extinction Lystrosaurus have dominated.
They emerged into an almost empty world and have been reaping the rewards.
Life is good.
But these mammal ancestors have had little competition or predators, until now.
With the planet recovering, some reptiles have grown to epic proportions.
This is an Erythrosuchid.
Nearly three meters long, it's the biggest predator of its time.
Herds of Lystrosaurus are an easy target.
They have no defense against this new type of reptile or even awareness of the threat it poses.
Like a fox in a chicken coop, an Erythrosuchid can kill more than it needs.
Lystrosaurus was the unwitting dodo of its age.
A combination of predators and competition saw Lystrosaurus go from total domination of the planet to extinction.
The mammals had lost their crown.
This was the age of reptiles.
Today, there are more than 10,000 species of reptile although they are not all as terrifying as their ancestors.
As the Earth has changed reptiles have had to adapt to an ever more crowded world.
And the tough, scaly skin that allowed them to conquer the deserts of Pangaea, continues to be the secret of their success.
For some, their skin has allowed them to become masters of disguise.
But skin can also be used to scare off an attacker.
Even then, there are times when more drastic measures are called for.
It may have escaped the bird, but lizards aren't known for their swimming prowess.
Yet the anole lizard of Costa Rica has an extraordinary survival technique.
As it exhales, it creates a bubble that sticks to its water-repellent skin forming its very own diving bell and allowing it to stay hidden underwater for up to 15 minutes.
Today's reptiles are such experts at living in the margins, it's hard to imagine they once dominated our planet.
But there's a series of islands in Indonesia that offer a glimpse into that very distant past.
For here, lizards still rule.
Recently hatched and already curious this youngster is starting life in a lizard paradise.
The only issue she has is her relatives.
For this is a baby Komodo dragon and Komodos are cannibals smelling the air with their forked tongue to find their prey.
For the world's largest lizards baby dragons make perfect snacks.
Luckily for her, a nest of buried Komodo eggs offers an easier meal.
But it won't satisfy this monster for long.
It'll be seven or eight years of hiding in trees before she's big enough to stand up for herself.
Too heavy to climb, the adult goes in search of something more accessible.
A thick layer of mud can't disguise this animal's scent.
Water buffalo are ever vigilant wary of their reptilian overlords.
But buffalo calves are not as savvy as their parents.
The dragon has lost its kill, but only temporarily.
Venom from a gland in its jaw prevents the blood of its prey from clotting, leading to a dangerous drop in blood pressure.
The result is inevitable.
This is an echo of what life was like back in the Triassic.
Mammals must fight for their lives, while reptiles dominate with a confident swagger.
But perhaps the most remarkable chapter of that early era of reptile supremacy was when some of them turned their back on the land and returned to the ocean.
Turtles.
Whether pushed here through competition or enticed by opportunity turtles went back to the seas their ancestors left, and today inhabit all but the coldest oceans.
Yet once a year, adult females must still return to dry land to lay their eggs.
Here, on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef they come together in their thousands.
Aggregations like this have been one of nature's greatest spectacles for millions of years.
There's a good reason for this gathering.
Safety in numbers.
Turtles first evolved back in the Triassic.
But by the time they'd conquered the seas, the ocean was home to deadly predators.
At eight meters long, this is a plesiosaur.
It, too, is a reptile, but one that spends its entire life at sea.
As the plesiosaur can only eat so much, gathering in huge numbers like this allows many more turtles to survive.
All that remains is to haul themselves up onto the beach where they were born and find the perfect spot to lay their eggs.
Almost two months later, and the females' efforts are rewarded.
Hatchlings.
But each one now has its own gauntlet to run as they instinctively head towards the ocean.
Pterosaurs.
Long before the existence of birds, this group of ancient reptiles made a huge evolutionary step.
They took to the wing and became masters of the air.
Totally defenseless this hatchling's only chance is to carry on ignoring the near misses, and hoping that the pterosaurs will be spoiled for choice.
Every lucky escape brings it closer to the water's edge.
Yet even those that reach the oceans aren't safe.
Only by getting to deeper water can it avoid the pterosaurs and escape into the blue.
Reptiles once ruled the skies and the waves.
But despite their supremacy, Pterosaurs and plesiosaurs would both go extinct in time.
Yet one of the ruling reptiles from this era has survived.
They're such perfect stealth hunters that even after 200 million years little has bettered them.
Oblivious to the danger wildebeest come to quench their thirst.
But it doesn't matter.
The Nile crocodile knows the wildebeest will return just as they always have.
To avoid detection, the crocodile silently submerges holding its breath for up to an hour.
Crocodiles can slow their heart rate to just two beats a minute almost completely shutting down in a way the reptiles perfected millions of years ago.
Yet in the moment it launches its attack it goes from inertia to explosive energy in just a fraction of a second generating enough speed and power to launch its five-meter-long body out of the water all on an empty stomach and a single breath.
It's a technique as successful for crocodiles now as it was for their prehistoric ancestors.
Today's crocodiles dominate the waters they live in but they are not the widespread predators they once were.
For back in the Triassic, the forces of nature would send the story of life in a completely new direction.
Sustained volcanic eruptions caused another period of global warming.
As sea temperatures rose, they supercharged oceanic evaporation.
In northern Pangaea, moisture-laden winds hit a 3,000-meter-high ridge creating megamonsoonal weather systems.
And it started to rain on a biblical scale.
Across the planet, storms raged.
The downpours lasted more than a million years turning the dry deserts of early Pangaea into a distant memory.
In the far north, torrents flowed from high in the mountains.
Surface water rewrote the landscape carrying with it nutrient-rich silt.
The waterways soon covered more than 1.6 million square kilometers an area the size of Alaska, creating the largest delta in Earth's history.
These fertile waterways became the lifeblood of a new world the fuel for evolution.
Conifers rose to the fore.
And for the first time since the Permian extinction our planet returned to a forested land of giants.
Many ancient reptiles failed to adapt to this new landscape.
But one group embraced this change in plant life and would soon rise to take over the world.
The youngsters start life much like other reptiles.
They hatch from eggs they have scaly skin and they are left to fend for themselves from the moment they enter the world.
But there are differences.
They have a much more efficient breathing system that continuously pumps blood across their lungs allowing them to run without having to stop to catch their breath.
Their legs extend beneath their body rather than to the side so they can walk upright.
This allows tiny hatchlings to grow into adults that are 50 times their size.
They're part of the reptile family tree, but are their own unique branch.
Early giants, like Plateosaurus, can reach the new taller food sources.
Their stomachs can digest the tough conifer needles and their sheer volume helps them maintain a higher body temperature day and night.
It's a winning formula that will herald a new age.
The Jurassic.
This new dynasty would rule for more than 150 million years.
A reign that would see the rise of some of the most iconic creatures to ever walk the Earth.
Welcome to the age of dinosaurs.
Since life first emerged on planet Earth, it has never stopped evolving driven by an ever-changing world and by intense competition.
But there was one remarkable era when evolution went into overdrive giving us many of the animals we still have today and the iconic giants that once ruled over them.
This is the story of the age of dinosaurs.
It's the dawn of the Jurassic period.
Pangaea, the supercontinent that witnessed the age of reptiles, is slowly tearing itself apart.
Shifting tectonic plates force rivers of magma to the surface beginning the total transformation of the planet.
Over millions of years, a molten fissure slices the giant landmass in two.
Water fills the rift between the newly formed continents.
As they grow further and further apart, brand-new environments are created causing the extinction of many but turbocharging evolution for the survivors and one group of animals in particular.
Deep in the towering forests of Jurassic North America the biggest animals to ever walk the Earth are on the rise.
Dinosaurs.
In the breakup of Pangaea, they've found themselves in a world of plenty.
Some, like Diplodocus, have grown to become 25 meters long.
But even at their size, they can never let down their guard for they aren't the only giants of the Jurassic.
Allosaurus.
Nearly nine meters long it's one of the largest predators on land in these early days of the dinosaurs' reign.
It probes for opportunity.
But it's not the adults it's after.
This Allosaurus is looking for much easier prey.
A baby Diplodocus.
Hatched from an egg no bigger than a grapefruit, she's too small to live among the herd where she might be trampled.
Instead, she must fend for herself.
The Allosaurus will make quick work of the baby if it can find her.
The youngster's best hope is to stay as still as possible.
The Allosaurus has keen senses but the storm is masking any clues to the baby's location.
A very close call and not just for one young Diplodocus.
To boost their chances of survival, these youngsters must eat as much as they can as fast as possible so they can grow into giant-sized adults.
But just as these huge dinosaurs were devouring the plants around them, the plants themselves were changing in ways that would revolutionize life on Earth.
Once upon a time, plants relied solely on wind or water to spread their pollen but in the age of dinosaurs, an innovation in plant reproduction arose that is still very much with us today.
The flower.
At 40 centimeters across, this one belongs to a giant water lily in South America's Amazon rainforest and its sole purpose is to attract an animal to pollinate it.
As evening approaches, the flower produces a powerful pineapple-like scent irresistible to this beetle.
Much like his ancient ancestors, the bewitched beetle can't help but be enticed inside.
He squeezes through the outer petals, into the heart of the flower, where paradise awaits.
Inside, it's a balmy ten degrees warmer than the surrounding night air.
Here, it happily feasts on the flower's succulent flesh.
But the beetle also offers something in return.
Pollen picked up from another giant water lily.
As it feeds, the pollen rubs off onto the flower's reproductive parts.
When dawn arrives, the flower closes enveloping the beetle in its velvety petals and covering it in its own sticky pollen.
At dusk, the flower opens once more.
Having served its purpose in helping the plant to reproduce, it changes color and loses its alluring scent allowing the beetle, now covered in this flower's pollen, to fly off and unwittingly pollinate another giant water lily.
But the relationship between flowers and their beetle pollinators was just the beginning.
Other insects in the dinosaur era soon got in on the action taking pollen from flower to flower in return for their sweet liquid nectar.
By 130 million years ago flowers were becoming more vivid, vibrant, and varied, as they competed to attract the very best pollinators.
As they spread the land turned from an endless green to a kaleidoscope of different colors.
Today, there are ten times more flowering plants than all other plant species combined.
However, as the world blossomed, other creatures began to exploit the relationship between flower and insect spawning a surge in the variety of predator and prey.
Spiders had been around for over 100 million years but now started spinning their silk into complex webs taking advantage of this new wave of life.
By the middle of the dinosaurs' reign there was such an explosion in biodiversity fueled by the arrival of flowering plants that, for the very first time in Earth's history, there were more species on land than in the oceans.
But it wasn't just the smaller creatures that were changing in new and radical ways.
This is Deinonychus.
Despite its endearing appearance, it's a dinosaur.
A baby dinosaur.
"Deinonychus" translates as "terrible claw."
But that's not his only strength.
He's also got keen vision and excellent hearing.
But his most eye-catching adaptation is his feathers.
Simple feather-like structures first appeared back in the Triassic.
Not for flight but for warmth.
Being able to stay warm means this branch of dinosaurs, the theropods, can be active day and night giving them more time to raise their young as part of a family.
Living in a group has other advantages too, especially when it's time to find food.
For Deinonychus is a pack hunter.
And a clever one at that.
Their prey, Arkansaurus, is also a dinosaur but it leads a very different, mainly plant-eating life.
What they both share, however is speed.
Catching up with their prey is one thing.
Bringing it down another.
Working together, they take turns to tire it out.
Their terrible claws bring a swift end to the exhausted Arkansaurus.
As dinosaurs diversified, many became increasingly social.
But even they couldn't compare with the greatest social animals of their age, animals that were evolving just beneath their feet.
Today, in West Africa, we can still find the descendants of those early supersocializers.
Termites.
One immense family of siblings five million strong all working tirelessly for the colony and their mother, the queen.
Social insects like termites first appeared in the age of dinosaurs recycling the new vegetation while also being the prime food source of their enemies.
A scout has followed their scent.
Armed with the news of her discovery, she races back to her nest.
She's a member of another ancient group of social insects the ants.
Competition between these rival species has been raging for millions of years in a remarkable evolutionary arms race.
Back at her nest, the scout summons an army of her own.
These are predatory Megaponera ants.
Like a well-drilled Roman legion a thousand soldiers march to war.
When close to the termite workers, the scout gives a signal and the column starts to fan out, becoming a wave poised to break.
Now, at full force, the scout gives one final order.
The termites are not defenseless.
They've evolved a separate caste of armed soldiers who protect the workers.
Catching an ant, they quickly dismember it.
But these ants have their own specialist weapons.
They thrust their venomous stings at their ancient rivals' only weak spot.
Right between the jaws.
The casualties in this age-old battle rapidly mount up.
But the marauding ants overwhelm the termites.
The victors gather up the vanquished and carry them back to the nest to feed the rest of the colony.
Underground, the ants display the pinnacle of their evolutionary achievements as they tend to their injured comrades.
Many have lost limbs.
But the workers lick the wounds of the injured, using antibiotics carried in their saliva to help them heal.
Without this, most would die.
But thanks to the treatment, they're able to march back out to war within 24 hours, even with missing limbs.
This is the only example of animals, other than humans, using medicine to save another's life.
By working together, social animals like ants and termites flourished under the dinosaurs.
But the ground beneath all their feet was still on the move, causing seismic change.
Ninety million years ago, and Earth's shifting tectonic plates continued to reshape the planet.
As the fragments of Pangaea spread out upwellings of magma began to lift the seafloor raising global sea levels.
This flooded the land creating numerous shallow seas and multiple island continents, each with their own climate and character.
Isolated on their respective landmasses, dinosaurs thrived like never before.
Alongside the long-necked giant sauropods and the feathered theropods another group of dinosaurs were also finding success.
The ornithischians.
Just like Diplodocus, they were mostly herbivores but they had evolved jaws that could chew.
Combined with the surge in plant life, this saw ornithischians, like Maiasaura, form some of the largest herds the Earth had ever seen.
Across the world, dinosaurs now dominated every land habitat the changing planet had to offer.
But at the same time our own dynasty, the first true mammals, were also making the most of the new abundance.
In the shadows of the giants, these small creatures were limited to a life in the margins.
But they, too, were becoming increasingly sophisticated, social, and able to take care of their young.
Today, in the forests of Southwest Australia, it's possible to get a glimpse of what life may have been like for some of those ancient mammals.
This is a numbat, an endangered marsupial thought to number only 3,000 in the wild.
Like some of her prehistoric ancestors, she, too, survives on a diet of tasty termites.
Using her long, sticky tongue, she scoops them up with relish.
And the more, the merrier for back at the den a handful of pups await her return.
Crucial to the success of mammals was the evolution of parental care.
Giving birth to live young and nourishing them on their mother's milk until they reach independence.
But for these nervous little youngsters that might take a while.
Most early mammals didn't have armor or size to protect them yet just like in today's forests danger was never far away.
The discarded skin of their ancient adversary.
The snake.
Snakes evolved around the same time as the first true mammals.
They lost the arms and legs of their reptilian ancestors and developed a streamlined body making them perfectly adapted to hunting in burrows and silently pursuing their prey through the undergrowth.
But young mammals aren't entirely helpless.
They have their mothers to look after them.
She spots the danger and raises the alarm.
But the snake is headed straight for her youngster.
Thanks to parental care, in this instance, the mammals win out.
But reptiles have patience.
They've been playing this game since the dawn of the dinosaurs.
And as mammals prospered, so too did the snakes that fed on them.
Today, there are more than 3,000 species of snake.
With their sinuous bodies packed with muscle they've evolved to exploit almost every habitat on Earth.
Even the oceans.
Like many reptiles, their skin can offer perfect camouflage.
When paired with venom, the effect can be deadly.
But mammals have acquired some extraordinary defenses having been locked in an arms race with snakes for more than a hundred million years.
The sidewinder snake.
It will wait for hours at a time for signs of passing heat.
Heat that comes from small warm-blooded mammals.
But kangaroo rats are not your average rodent.
They've developed a unique skill befitting of their name.
The cold-blooded sidewinder bides its time.
It can go weeks without eating just waiting to strike.
Split-second reactions versus incredible patience.
These are the extremes that can evolve in the eternal game of life and death.
After 150 million years of dinosaur rule, the continents had shifted almost to where they are today.
Along the way, they had created so many new environments that the dinosaurs had become more successful than ever before.
Beneath their feet lived all the major animal groups that we recognize now.
Dynasties from throughout the ages.
Survivors from another era.
Along with those that had more recently come to the fore.
But all of them forced to the margins by the dominance of the dinosaurs and the one iconic animal that ruled over them all.
Thirteen meters long, weighing nine tons it's no wonder that the most famous predator in the history of life on our planet is Tyrannosaurus rex.
But he's not alone.
Another T. rex.
The two size each other up.
Tyrannosaurs will often fight for territory and are not above cannibalism.
But there's something else on this male's mind for he has found a female.
And that means showing off his best moves to win her over.
But misjudge the approach, and this date could be over in seconds.
His mesmerizing movement and deep romping calls seem to be eliciting the right response.
And she mirrors his courtship dance.
But the ultimate sign of trust is exposing his neck.
Rising together, they cement their bond.
For 150 million years, dinosaurs ruled the planet.
Who knows what new heights they might have reached if their reign had continued.
But in the story of life nothing lasts forever.
It's winter but like none the world has ever known.
This is a post-apocalyptic winter.
Sixty-six million years ago, and the world has all but been destroyed by a cataclysmic event.
This is the story of the fall of the dinosaurs and the rise from the ashes of the survivors who would inherit the Earth.
Our story begins in the Cretaceous period on a day that would change the course of history.
For Edmontosaurus in North America, it's nesting season.
As usual, this female must tend to her hungry young giving them the best possible start in life.
A thousand kilometers south, an adult tyrannosaur is teaching her offspring the art of the hunt.
But they're a little impatient.
The youngsters still have a lot to learn.
Perhaps they'll have more luck tomorrow.
To the west, a herd of Alamosaurus some of the largest dinosaurs to have ever lived, begin their day as they have for generations, enjoying tender pine shoots.
Below the waves, off the coast of Africa, the oceans are bountiful, bursting with life a realm dominated by huge marine reptiles.
Along with the dinosaurs, they have ruled planet Earth for a staggering 150 million years.
But today will be a day like no other.
An asteroid the size of Mount Everest is tumbling towards Earth at 100,000 kilometers per hour.
Its impact will change the world forever unleashing the power of a billion atomic bombs setting in motion a devastating chain of events.
First comes a deadly blast of thermal radiation.
Every living thing within a thousand kilometers is vaporized in a matter of seconds.
The planet's crust buckles from the impact, sending seismic shock waves around the world.
In mere minutes off-the-scale earthquakes rock the globe.
For the Alamosaurus this is just the beginning.
The earthquakes trigger a series of giant waves that rip through seas and inland lakes.
Huge surges of water sweep across North America.
The rapidly rising torrent is impossible to withstand, even for the mightiest.
Less than an hour after impact, debris ejected into space is pulled back to Earth by gravity.
On re-entry, it turns scorching red-hot.
The super-heated atmosphere advances like a fiery hell.
On the ground, it's like standing under a 400-degree grill.
Animals are slowly cooked alive.
To make matters worse, the rock debris starts to rain down.
Less than two hours after impact, the firestorm of choking dust has enveloped half the planet.
It's so hot, trees burst into flames.
The growing inferno is impossible to escape.
Nothing can save them now.
The great reign of the dinosaurs, over in a single day.
The oceans were just as devastated as the land.
Sulfur-rich dust poured down as acid rain.
Ancient reefs were obliterated.
The web of life collapsed, killing off the great marine reptiles.
Their bodies provided a lifeline for scavengers, searching out death in the deep.
Arthropods.
Sharks.
Away from the carnage of the asteroid, many life-forms survived, devouring the immense carcasses feasting on extinction.
But back on the surface, the picture couldn't have been more different.
For years after the impact, Earth looked dead.
The forests, the plains, the mountains, lifeless.
But as the dust cloud dispersed and the light finally returned it became clear that all was not lost.
The insects were some of the first to emerge feeding on the fallen.
Survivors were protected by burrows cocoons and armored bodies.
Sheltering below ground some reptiles survived too.
Beneath the surface of river deltas and wetlands, others were also shielded from the mayhem.
The amphibians.
With little food around, only small creatures had made it including from our dynasty, the mammals.
They'd inherited a planet free of dinosaurs.
Or so it seemed.
Against the odds, another group of animals had also clung on protected by their very own life-support capsules.
Remarkably, inside them was a type of dinosaur.
More specifically, an avian dinosaur otherwise known as the birds.
Before the apocalypse, there had been hundreds of ancient species living in the trees, all wiped out when the forests burned.
But a handful of ground-dwelling birds did make it through.
These survivors were kept warm by feathers and were self-sufficient from their first breath able to live on insects and seeds and capable of walking within hours.
Sixty-six million years ago, birds had become the last remaining branch of the dinosaur family tree.
From such humble creatures, a great dynasty would rise.
But their incredible story first began long, long before the asteroid.
The Jurassic.
An era of giants.
But this lost world of vertical cliffs was shaping a smaller breed of creature.
It lived in a dangerous realm.
To survive, it had evolved in an extraordinary new way.
This is Anchiornis.
She's a small, feathered dinosaur with needle-sharp teeth for hunting insects.
But she, too, is being hunted.
A juvenile Sinraptor.
And he's hungry.
Anchiornis is slow and clumsy.
The Sinraptor has her cornered.
But Anchiornis has run here for a reason.
She can fly.
One small step for a dinosaur, but one giant leap for life on Earth.
With these early gliders, a new dynasty was born.
And it was flight that would help their descendants stay alive in the era after the asteroid.
Today, there's a place where we can see how that story may have played out.
It's a harsh, desolate world.
Four thousand meters up, the Altiplano desert in Chile a landscape where almost nothing can live.
But one group of animals has found a way to survive here.
The birds.
Like those that evolved after the asteroid flamingos have taken the gliding skills of the first avian dinosaurs and created a new kind of flight.
A revolution in the air.
Wings that have been modified to flap.
This is powered flight, and it allows flamingos to travel in search of food just as birds did millions of years ago.
Feathers, that first evolved to keep dinosaurs warm, have become specialized for aerial mastery.
And that's not the only change.
Teeth have been replaced by beaks that allow them to feed on new diets.
But advances in feeding and flight alone were not enough to ensure the future of the birds.
They also drew on a rather flamboyant ancient behavior, a behavior that ensures the survival of the fittest.
Courtship.
For the flamingos, that means a dance-off and it's taken very seriously.
The judges are extremely fussy.
And they need to be to choose the best mates.
Birds had almost been wiped out with the rest of the dinosaurs.
Instead, thanks to their feathery talents, they'd have a chance to rise.
But their path would not be easy.
In the aftermath of the asteroid, global temperatures plunged by a staggering 25 degrees.
But thanks to their ability to survive the cold, just a few million years after the impact, the pine forests had returned.
Seeds ensured that the giant conifers from the days of the dinosaurs made it through.
The greatest of them all, reaching over 100 meters into the air, were the redwoods.
Sheltered beneath the forests was a group of warm-blooded animals that had long hidden in the shadows.
The mammals.
At first, they were small creatures, similar to voles.
With the dinosaurs gone, they were free to come out in the open.
But just five million years after the asteroid, the pine forest became home to a new breed of creature.
And they still haunt our forests today.
The owls.
Birds had turned from mere survivors into predators.
This is the great gray owl.
She's armed with razor-sharp claws and even sharper eyesight making her deadly on the wing.
Able to fly in near silence, she listens for prey.
For tiny mammals, nowhere is safe.
While the first owls were menacing the northern pine forests, elsewhere, another important habitat was emerging.
The asteroid had wiped out three-quarters of all Earth's plant and animal species.
In the tropics, it took six million years, but life did eventually return.
However, this time, it was totally different.
The revival was powered by a huge increase in the diversity of flowering plants.
Richer than anything that had gone before the tropical rainforests.
This thriving habitat was built on the close relationship between flowers and their insect pollinators.
But there was a new arrival who muscled in on the insect's domain.
Using incredible flying skills, they could navigate the complex world of the jungle.
They'd become miniature, granting them access to the flower's sweet nectar.
And their descendants are still at it today.
The hummingbirds.
To plunder the nectar, they've evolved to hover just like insects beating wings at 80 times a second.
Elongated beaks allow them to feed on a kaleidoscope of different flowers.
The hummingbirds outmaneuver many of their insect rivals.
But all this activity comes with a huge thirst for energy.
So the best flowers are worth fighting for.
Beaks double as weapons.
But one species of hummingbird has no need to battle.
It has an extraordinary adaptation that leaves the competition standing.
Enter the swordbill.
He boasts an impressively long appendage.
His beak is like a key in a lock, so only he can enjoy the hard-to-reach nectar of the angel trumpet flower.
In the ages following the apocalypse, giant dinosaurs may have no longer roamed the forest, but their tiny cousins had recolonized them in a completely new way.
But becoming small wouldn't work in every part of the planet.
The death of the dinosaurs had left many of Earth's great habitats free for the taking.
None more so than the plains.
And in early South America, 46 million years after the asteroid, ground-dwelling birds had the space to evolve into the deadliest predator since Tyrannosaurus rex.
Stalking among the glades of palms it has inherited the most aggressive traits from its ancient bloodline.
In the clearing, a herd of early mammals graze.
Theosodon, about the size of a modern-day llama.
An adult female keeps a keen watch.
But she hasn't seen the terror bird.
With a head like a pickaxe and standing two and a half meters tall, it sacrificed flight for raw power.
She senses something is wrong.
But the terror bird moves in near silence.
The hunt is on.
Able to rapidly accelerate to 50 kilometers an hour he's picked out a youngster trailing behind.
Using the weight of his giant head, he's a master at changing direction.
Time to deliver the final blow.
The savage terror birds now dominated the plains of South America.
But on the other side of the world, the ever-shifting continents were writing a new chapter in the story of life.
Australia had been heading north for millions of years.
As it did so, it created a vast shallow sea.
A new cradle of life.
Part plant, part animal, these are the corals.
Using energy from the Sun, they formed the largest living structure our planet has ever seen the tropical reefs.
Fifteen million years ago, these giant marine cities offered opportunity to a wealth of survivors.
From the depths came the sharks.
The reefs also drew in some of the last remaining marine reptiles the turtles.
Within this underwater paradise, countless new kinds of fish also evolved.
The growing abundance soon spilled out to the wider ocean filling it with life.
And this had not gone unnoticed by one relentless dynasty.
Yet again, the birds.
More specifically, seabirds.
Millions of years ago, they found a spectacular way to plunder the ocean's bounty with an aerial invasion.
And it's still happening today.
The greatest invaders of them all are the gannets.
Their keen vision means they can spot a ball of fish a mile away.
Diving from altitude, they pierce the surface at close to 90 kilometers an hour.
A specially adapted skull and retractable wings turn them into living missiles.
What's more, gannets can hold their breath for more than 40 seconds.
These ancient seabirds are master hunters.
Their aerial assault allows them to compete with the ocean's greatest predators, the sharks.
Feeding frenzies like these are still some of nature's grandest spectacles, just as they were 15 million years ago.
Dinosaurs never conquered the oceans, but their avian descendants finally found a way.
Their conquest of the seas was so successful, seabirds established vast colonies across the planet now some of the most incredible gatherings of life on Earth.
But the birds' triumph over the oceans was not quite complete.
Their crowning achievement can best be seen in a world lost in time.
The Galápagos Islands.
These are marine iguanas, descendants of lizards that survived the asteroid.
Like most reptiles, they must bask in the sun to warm up.
But they're not the only sunbathers here.
They're joined by an extraordinary bird.
The penguin.
And this is the Galápagos penguin.
Over tens of millions of years, its ancestors repurposed their wings, fine-tuning them to no longer fly in the air, but to pull off something remarkable beneath the waves.
Underwater flight.
Penguins have sublime buoyancy control and one of the most streamlined bodies of any animal, making them the world's greatest swimming birds.
Scanning for fish, it hovers like a hummingbird with perfect poise.
In contrast, the cold-blooded iguanas are slow and sluggish restricted to feeding on low-energy kelp at the whim of the currents.
The warm-blooded penguins couldn't be more different with their speed and agility chasing down fish with ease.
Underwater flight allowed the penguins to exploit the seas like never before.
Their strategy has been so successful, they've colonized all the continents of the Southern Hemisphere evolving into the 18 different species we know today.
The final epic chapter for the birds, a dynasty that was almost wiped out.
But thanks to the few survivors of the dinosaur family tree, birds rose from the ashes.
Over 66 million years, they've reinvented themselves into a myriad of forms.
Today, 10,000 species strong, they've found a way to thrive in almost every corner of the planet.
But they are not the only ones to have conquered the world.
Not so long ago, the Americas were still at the mercy of the terror birds.
But these apex predators would soon become the prey.
Other survivors of the asteroid had also been evolving.
No longer in the shadow of the dinosaurs they'd grown bigger and more dangerous.
It was time for the rise of the mammals.
In the four billion years of life on our planet, countless species have risen and fallen.
But one remarkable dynasty has had a greater impact than any other.
The mammals.
This is the story of their epic journey to become rulers of the world.
Hidden in the ancient Jurassic forests mammals came from humble beginnings ruled over by the greatest dynasty that ever lived the dinosaurs.
They dominated so totally that early mammals were confined to the shadows.
For the most part, they were small, keeping to the trees away from the giants.
They became nocturnal, developing a range of heightened senses that helped them in the dark.
Under the dinosaurs' rule, there was a limit to how far they could rise.
But in time, everything changed.
One of the most violent events in our planet's history heralded a new era.
Despite the devastation, the planet did recover.
Within a few million years, forests had regrown and carpeted much of the land.
The climate became hot and wet.
The perfect conditions for life to flourish.
A world primed for a new wave of evolution.
The asteroid had inflicted devastating losses on the mammals yet some of the smaller ones, able to hide in holes, had survived.
Free of the dinosaurs, they could finally venture out of the shadows and come into the open.
Like their ancestors, coatis have many adaptations that help them thrive in the rich rainforest.
Extremely social, they find safety in numbers.
The mother's flexible nose can smell food hidden beneath the leaf litter.
A supersense honed over millions of years of foraging in the darkness.
Like all mammals, coatis are warm-blooded, so can be active at all times.
That means these babies need plenty of energy.
Fortunately, mammals have evolved an extraordinary solution.
Milk.
They can feed their young whenever they choose, even when food is scarce.
But milk wasn't the early mammals' only secret weapon.
They also had brain power.
And it's still just as important today.
In the forests of Costa Rica, this capuchin monkey is trying to solve a puzzle.
How to get the meat from inside a closed clam.
The monkey isn't strong enough to crack the shell but it's discovered that repeated hammering will tire the clam until it finally opens.
Learning this lesson takes a large brain and coordination.
This unique intelligence allowed their primate ancestors to survive in the forest of 50 million years ago.
Clever animals tend to be inquisitive and that can pay huge dividends.
This female has learned and remembered where she can find water.
But it's too deep to reach.
Luckily, she has an inspired solution.
She turns her tail into a sponge.
But not all their challenges are to do with finding food and water.
Some fruit is collected not to eat but to rub over their bodies.
This fruit contains citronella, an oil that mosquitoes can't stand.
The monkeys have discovered their very own insect repellent.
Free from pesky biting insects, the clever capuchins can finally relax.
But just as their ancestors were beginning to make progress, the warm, wet conditions in which they had thrived began to change.
The Antarctic landmass started to split away from South America creating the space for new ocean currents that helped drive a global cooling.
The climate was switching into a new, colder state.
But that was just the beginning.
As Antarctica became colder and more isolated, the huge continent froze, locking up much of the planet's fresh water.
As the world further north dried out, it became a harsher, more difficult place to live.
Food became more spread out, harder to find.
And as the Earth changed, so did the mammals.
Some became enormous.
A male Megacerops.
Two and a half meters tall four meters long and three tons in weight.
Its huge size allows it to travel large distances in search of food and ensures it has reserves to get through leaner times.
Mammals were now big enough to rival the long-lost dinosaurs.
But being big has other implications especially when it comes to finding a mate.
This female is already closely guarded by a male, much larger than the first.
If challenged, he could seriously injure his opponent.
But the smaller male may be in luck.
Another female, and she seems to be alone.
It's the chance he's been waiting for.
He has a rival.
This time, they're evenly matched.
With these mammals size matters.
But even the mightiest Megacerops couldn't overcome the planet's next great challenge.
The formation of Antarctica was creating global climate chaos.
As ocean currents shifted and the planet dried it became a tinderbox.
Wildfires ravaged the land clearing the way for something completely different something that would challenge mammals as never before.
As the smoke cleared, there rose from the ashes a life-form that had previously only survived in the margins.
Grass.
Taking root during the great drying it spread so quickly, it would soon cover one-fifth of the land.
But the endless plains were no paradise for the mammals.
Many couldn't digest grass and soon went extinct.
Twenty million years later, and today's grazing mammals remain locked in an arms race with this green invader.
They have evolved a whole swathe of game-changing adaptations.
Specialized teeth, strengthened to prevent silica in the grass from wearing them out and huge bellies to process it all.
Their young are born fully formed able to walk within hours of birth and follow their herd in search of fresh growth.
Mammals have truly conquered the grassy plains their huge numbers the most obvious sign of this exceptional success.
But just as some mammals evolved to feed on the grass, others evolved to feed on the grazers.
Hunters.
The herd has its own defense against the cheetahs' blistering speed.
Many eyes spot the danger early.
Running bodies create confusion for the young to hide in.
But the big cat has a plan forged by its clever mammalian brain.
Panic the herd, split them up, and target a lone calf.
Desperate to defend her only calf, the female wildebeest counters.
The chase is far from over.
The cheetah has lost a lot of ground but the calf is tiring.
As the youngster turns, it's the hunter who must now run for its life.
The calf is safe once more but the cheetah will be back and the war between the grassland mammals will continue as it has done for millions of years.
In prehistoric South America, the grasslands played host to the same battle but with very different animals.
This giant armadillo is also a mammal though one the size of a car.
Doedicurus may not be fast, but what they lack in speed they make up for with armor and a lethal tail adaptations that protect them and their young from any would-be predators.
A Smilodon but a mere youngster.
He's not a serious threat even with his dagger-like teeth.
He's never seen a Doedicurus up close, and their defenses are intriguing.
His curiosity gets the better of him.
He explores every angle.
For the young Doedicurus, the only option is to stay put.
The giant armadillos' armor is completely impregnable and they know it.
But there is one obvious opportunity.
The young Doedicurus is so much smaller.
If he can get a hold on it he might be able to turn it over.
But not with the adults around.
Another stalemate.
Battles between the mammals have always driven their evolution, and they don't just happen in the grasslands.
Fifty million years ago, what are now India and Asia collided on an epic scale.
The crash forced the land into the sky, creating the towering Himalayas.
Today, they are 2,500 kilometers long, almost nine kilometers high, and still growing.
With their freezing temperatures and thin air, these mountains are uninhabitable for most animals.
But not all.
Deep in a sunless valley a male snow leopard and an ibex that has fallen to its death.
The leopard is very old, worn and tattered by his harsh mountain life.
At these altitudes, mammals must feed regularly to keep warm.
But the Himalayas present the ultimate hunting challenge.
High above the valley, a female and her cubs, fathered by the male.
Three of them in total, all amazingly camouflaged.
Snow leopards have thick fur, large paws, and long tails perfect adaptations for the coldest, most precipitous nursery on Earth.
Away from the dangerous cliffs the mother initiates a hunting lesson.
Teaching and caring for one's young is a key mammalian trait.
These cubs will stay with their mother for nearly two years learning the skills needed to survive on the very edge of life.
At these altitudes, every opportunity must be taken.
The old male is tracking a herd.
In this vertical world, he must get above his prey and close enough for an ambush.
This time death has claimed them both.
But the leopard's legacy lives on.
In a few months' time, his cubs will leave their mother and start to hunt alone, having learned all the skills they need to survive at the top of the world.
Although they had conquered the land, the mammals didn't stop there.
One branched out and went in an entirely different direction.
Fifty million years ago, bats opened up a whole new realm through flight.
Flying allows animals to search much further for food and gather in their millions.
Today, one in five of all mammal species is a bat.
But bats were not the first animals to take to the skies.
Having spent the night foraging, these fruit bats are in a race to return to the roost for with daylight comes danger.
Birds.
They evolved flight long before the mammals.
Faster and stronger than bats eagles are armed with deadly talons.
But as dusk falls, the skies belong to the bats once more.
Millions take to the wing, knowing that safety lies in numbers and in the coming darkness.
At the same time as bats were first moving into the air, other mammals were moving into the sea attracted by the abundance of food hidden beneath the waves.
The mammals' journey into the oceans was a gradual one.
These are Maiacetus, two-and-a-half-meter-long ancestors of the whales.
But unlike whales, they still spend much of their time lazing on land.
It's in the water that they come alive chasing schools of fish.
His time down here is limited by how long he can hold his breath.
He seems caught between two worlds, especially when facing danger.
The mammal's intelligence is his only defense but he can't stay down here forever.
Otodus.
Twice the length of a great white shark.
With finely-tuned senses, it can pinpoint his exact location, and it's in no hurry to make its move.
The Maiacetus is running out of air.
In open water, there's no escape.
An overhang offers refuge.
But time is running out.
A gully provides cover.
Safe and able to breathe once more.
Mammals had a long way to go to become masters of the world's oceans, but it was only a matter of time.
As the planet continued to cool, it fed an explosion of life allowing the giants of today to evolve.
The mammals had gone from tiny land animals to being bigger than dinosaurs.
With each giant breath, they use oxygen far more effectively than Maiacetus.
And being warm-blooded, their muscles are always at a temperature for maximum performance allowing the whales to generate sustained bursts of energy.
When competing for a mate, humpback males exploit this ability to the full pursuing a single female.
This is much more than about speed.
The males stay as close to the female as possible so she can judge their strength and stamina.
Bubble streaming intimidates rivals.
The males plow into each other.
Some get left behind, still fighting.
The main group keeps up the chase hot on the tail of the female.
Then suddenly, she stops.
Hanging in the water she has called off the race.
She has made her decision and allows one male to approach.
The mammals have conquered every habitat on Earth.
Land, air, and sea.
The asteroid strike had allowed the mammals to go from lowly underdogs to become a global power.
Such is the role of chance in the history of life on our planet.
But there is one more chapter in the mammal story still to be told.
Two and a half million years ago, the mammals were faced with a new challenge.
What had been a slow cooling of the planet intensified.
The start of an ice age.
From its frozen wastes would come a new force a mammal armed with more intelligence and adaptability than any before.
The most dangerous animal the world had ever seen.
For 90% of our planet's history, it has been too warm for ice to form.
So when the Ice Age hit two and a half million years ago, its impact was huge.
This is the story of a great freeze and the rise of a dynasty that would bring life to the brink of extinction.
Yellowstone is one of the coldest places in America.
In winter, it still endures some of the same freezing conditions that an ice age brings.
Temperatures can drop below minus 50 degrees.
Only those built for the cold can survive.
A bison's thick coat is such good insulation, they need little energy to keep warm which is just as well, as grass is hard to find beneath the snow.
But bison aren't the only hungry ones here.
Wolves can also withstand the coldest of winters and have been hunting bison in America for more than 100,000 years.
To split up the herd the pack needs to get them moving.
Panic gives the wolves control.
The herd must stick together.
One trip could prove fatal.
But the bison can't run forever, especially in the deep snow.
Their only hope is to turn and face their pursuers.
Only then does the pack finally relent.
But no matter where they go, the wolves will follow.
Age-old enemies that have been locked in battle for millennia.
Yet these ancient adversaries are lucky for they can look forward to the end of winter and the relief of spring.
But there was a time when winter never seemed to end.
Two and a half million years ago, changes in the Earth's orbit, ocean currents, and carbon dioxide levels led to an abrupt cooling of the planet.
The great Ice Age had begun and it started with the tiniest of things.
On its own, a snowflake is a fragile, frozen wonder.
No two the same.
But together, snowflakes changed the world.
Without warm summers to melt them, snow blanketed the north of the globe and over thousands of years, compacted to form permanent ice sheets several kilometers thick.
Here, in this silent realm, life was frozen out of existence.
But south of the ice sheets, a new world was created where life could thrive.
Circling almost the entire Northern Hemisphere, the tundra-steppe became Earth's most extensive habitat.
Mammals that adapted well to the cold dominated these frigid lands including the largest and most iconic of them all woolly mammoths.
Their elephant-like ancestors left Africa millions of years earlier and evolved into these highly specialized beasts.
Long hair, smaller ears, and shorter tails help them conserve heat in the cold.
They are guided by an old female, the matriarch, who passes her knowledge down the generations.
Generations she needs to keep safe.
Bigger than lions today, cave lions can bring down the very largest of prey.
But smaller is easier.
With little cover, the brazen cats don't even try to hide.
Instead, they bide their time, waiting for the right moment.
The calf must stay close to its protectors but the hunters have him in their sights.
The mammoths form a wall of tusks but the lions aren't going anywhere.
The matriarch has had enough but one of the hunters spots an opportunity.
The teenager will never stray from the herd again.
Now it's the lions' turn to defend.
The calf's mother knows it's a lost cause.
They have no choice but to back down and protect the generations that remain.
All they can do is continue their migration across the cold tundra-steppe.
While ice never completely engulfed the planet, its impact was still felt across the globe sometimes in the most unexpected ways.
With most of the world's water locked up as ice, the land became increasingly dry.
This is the flip side of an ice age.
South of the tundra-steppe, the deserts almost doubled in size, devouring everything in their path.
Only desert specialists that had evolved to withstand extreme heat could survive such hostile conditions.
But the drying didn't stop there.
Even further south, Africa's tropical rainforests, stable sanctuaries for life for over 50 million years, almost completely disappeared replaced by a vast expanse of dry forest and grassland.
The impact on life was huge, not least on one group of animals the primates.
Baboons share 94% of their DNA with us, as well as a crucial part of our story.
The descent from the treetops to a life on the forest floor.
Down here, during the Ice Age, our cousins faced many new challenges.
Life on the ground is more dangerous home to large predators.
Fortunately, what primates lack in strength and size, we make up for with intelligence and large families.
But finding enough food to feed many mouths is a constant challenge.
So when food is found, it attracts plenty of attention.
And where there's a precious resource conflict is inevitable not least with your own kind.
A rival troop with no appetite for sharing.
In the dry forest, every fruit is worth fighting for and every fight counts.
The rival troop cut their losses.
But they'll be back.
To overcome the challenges of a more hostile world, primates relied on their social intelligence, a trait that, in time, would lead to one species of primate achieving global domination.
The buildup of ice in the north affected the climate across the planet.
But just as life got used to colder, drier conditions, everything changed.
The ice began to melt as Earth's orbit shifted once more and global temperatures began to rise.
What started as a series of meltwater streams soon turned into a deluge.
In North America, the meltwater formed an enormous glacial lake 600 meters deep and covering 10,000 square kilometers.
The only thing stopping the water from flooding the land to the west was a towering wall of ice.
On the far side, the wall was almost a kilometer high a seemingly unstoppable barrier but not for much longer.
As temperatures kept rising and the meltwater lake kept growing, the pressure from behind increased.
Before long, the walls started to crumble from the inside out until finally, catastrophic collapse.
In an instant, a lake the size of the Irish Sea is unleashed.
Thirty kilometers south, and the first hint of the coming apocalypse.
Tremors.
They sense danger but there's nowhere to hide.
The first they see is a wall of dust.
A hundred meters high, it's the vanguard of a giant tsunami.
In just ten hours, the megaflood smashes an 800-kilometer-long path through the American continent, all the way to the ocean.
Natural wonders that might otherwise take millennia to form are created in a matter of hours.
But these spectacles are short-lived.
Just a few days later, all that remains is an eerie silence.
The indelible scars of this megaflood still mark the American landscape today yet since the dawn of the Ice Age, there have been more than 50 cycles of ice buildup and melt each causing its own epic floods.
Once the turmoil of the last great melt subsided, balance slowly returned across the land.
Rainfall became more regular allowing forests to bounce back.
Deserts shrunk and greened as, once again, water flowed.
And where water flows, life soon follows.
Europe's Danube delta is one of the largest wetlands in the world.
It formed after the last great melt and quickly became home to an incredible wealth of animal life.
With so much food on offer, whiskered terns travel thousands of kilometers to breed in these rich waters.
It's the perfect place to raise a family but it's a wasted journey if a male arrives too late to find a female.
All he can do is watch the success of others.
With his rival gone now is his chance.
Food makes an excellent gift but she's not impressed.
He tries his luck nonetheless but to no avail.
The spurned male must dine alone.
Only when life is so bountiful can females afford to be so choosy.
The end of the Ice Age ushered in not only a time of plenty but also a time of great climate stability a time known as the Holocene.
During this period, warm, wet conditions prevailed and average global temperatures fluctuated by less than one degree Celsius, allowing life to flourish in every corner of the world each species boasting an unbroken line of ancestry stretching back four billion years to the very origin of life on Earth.
However, not everything thrived during the Holocene.
A strange and highly selective extinction was underway.
Across the planet, the largest land animals were disappearing.
Mammoths, cave lions, and hundreds of other species vanished.
North America was particularly hard-hit, losing over 70% of its giants but not all.
In the absence of competitors, bison took over the great plains roaming in huge numbers.
But they weren't alone.
With fewer big prey to choose from, bison became the focus of another group of survivors.
Age-old enemies.
Their best defense is to keep an eye on the danger, stick together, and calmly move on.
But these are no ordinary hunters for the Ice Age saw the spread of a new predator.
Like wolves, we hunted in groups.
And what we lacked in strength and speed we made up for with intelligence and cunning.
The evolution of our large, complex brains had set us apart from other primates and enabled us to hunt in increasingly sophisticated ways.
Mimicking wolves and using carefully placed stone stacks, hunters corralled the bison for miles, until they were exactly where they wanted them.
Only then do they close in behind the herd.
Reveal themselves too soon and days of effort will be wasted.
Their ultimate prize isn't the death of one, but the fall of many to feed many over the winter months.
The trap is set.
All they need is a little encouragement.
By the early Holocene, humans had spread out of Africa to almost every continent on Earth and become the world's most dangerous predator.
While our rise contributed to the global extinction of large land animals, our story could have been a short one had we not done something remarkable.
We freed ourselves from the uncertainty of a hunter-gatherer existence by forming alliances with nature.
The stable climate of the Holocene enabled our ancestors to develop a unique relationship with plants.
They hand-selected certain species and sowed their seeds where they were best able to grow.
All this care and attention dramatically increased the plants' chances of survival, and in return, humans could reap the rewards.
They learned how to produce more food and to make it last all year round.
And where their plants grew, people prospered.
Our ancestors discovered how to ensure a stable food supply.
And it wasn't just plants they domesticated.
Animals too.
Across the world, many hunter-gatherers gave up their nomadic lifestyles in favor of farming.
Slowly but surely, the wilderness was transformed, tamed by human hands.
Freed from the constant battle to find food, human populations grew, work diversified, society became more complex and civilizations were born.
We achieved something no other species has ever done.
We broke free of nature and rose above it.
Agriculture changed everything but another revolution was coming.
Our ingenuity has taken us further than we could ever have imagined, and our story is now written on the surface of the Earth.
What was once wild has been tamed or lost.
We're too successful for our own good and for that of the planet and we are now causing the next mass extinction.
It's not just that simply feeding ourselves takes up more than half of all habitable land and it's not just that the carbon dioxide we are releasing is heating our planet faster than at any time in the last 500 million years.
Nor is it just that we are warming and acidifying the oceans, destroying their natural balance and killing off vast swathes of marine life.
Nor is it just that we are causing extreme weather events fire and drought that are returning the Earth to its barren beginnings.
And it's not just that we are doing any one of these but that we are doing all of them, all at the same time.
And to make matters worse, we are doing it at meteoric speed.
Although rare, mass extinctions change the course of history like nothing else.
So far, Earth has endured five of these apocalyptic events, each one wiping out more than three-quarters of all life.
What's more, the dominant species going in are not the dominant species coming out.
The impact of a mass extinction has not been felt for 66 million years.
Now we're on track for the sixth.
In the last 50 years alone, wildlife populations have fallen by an average of almost 70%, and this time, we are the ones responsible.
And yet despite this grim forecast, there remains a glimmer of hope.
We are the first species in the four-billion-year story of life to understand what is happening to our world.
We are also the first species to understand what is needed to put it right.
Our intelligence has brought us this far, and it's the only thing that can save us.
Our future, and that of the planet, is yet to be written.
How we act now will determine the next chapter.
But whatever future awaits in the story of life.
It's that life has always found a way.
Nothing will ever be the same after tonight.
Some of the artists, some of the people, some of the personalities.
Tonight is gonna be one of the most unreal nights we've ever experienced, and I'm glad I have a good seat 'cause I don't wanna miss a thing.
Your timing is perfect.
Bruce, Lionel, you're all good? Good. Yeah.
Bruce,Smokey's here too.
Happy new year, baby.Steve!
The greatest artists of a generation came together with all of our ego, with all of our talent, to save some lives.
Must be in a dream?
Okay, guys.
But we only had one night. They're not coming back tomorrow.
Let's go! Now, here's what we're gonna do.
It was busy and buzzy, and people didn't know what we were gonna be doing.
You're exhilarated, you know, just from the unusualness of the evening.
There was nothing more chaotic than trying to rope this creative ball of energy together.
This was history happening right now.
One, two.Let's put it on tape!
All right, let's go!
Legends of rock music.
The most super of superstars.
Are you ready for me?
Here is a unique young singer.
The most exciting superstars in the music world today.
All right.
Let's get this party started.
I will try to take you back as far as I can remember.
In the early '80s, I'd left the Commodores.
Ken Kragen, my new manager, he said, "first of all, your songs are more famous than you are, so we're gonna stick your face next to all of those wonderful songs."
Mr. Lionel Richie!
My solo album and stuff was happening, and so the career was taking off.
I'm a night person, so everything in life was happening after one o'clock in the morning.
And then, one night, I received this call from Ken that changed everything.
Ken Kragen ran a talent management company.
He had the most stellar reputation.
Ken Kragen!
Ken was a superstar.
He was as much a superstar as the artist, but he was a superstar in the business of music.
One morning, there was an unplanned meeting.
We walked in, and we're greeted by Harry Belafonte.
That stops you in your tracks.
You're looking at Hollywood royalty.
He's legendary.
I just knew something big was about to happen.
Harry Belafonte was an elder statesman.
He had graduated from being a working actor and singer.
He was still doing all that stuff, but, for the most part, we looked at him as this iconic figure, and he had such social impact.
We believe that artists have a valuable function in any society, since it is the artists who reveal the society to itself.
Much like civil rights needed to be amplified, Harry Belafonte felt that the issues of poverty in the world, certainly in Africa, needed to be told.
For some time now, we have been hearing reports of another famine in Africa, this time in Ethiopia.
But with all else that's going on these days, so often those reports don't have much impact.
People starving in Africa was as far away from us as you could be.
It was just something that we saw on commercials or in documentaries.
This mother and the baby she bore two months ago wrapped together in death.
A hungry child dies silently.
In Africa, they're dying by the thousands.
How do you look at all this overwhelming force of need and hunger?
Something must be done.
Harry Belafonte said, "let's do a concert,"
and Bob Geldof had already done the Band Aid single about, oh, a month or so before.
I said Harry, let's just take the idea that Bob already gave us.
Let's do it. But let's get the greatest stars in America to do it.
Kragen said I just got off the phone with Harry Belafonte.
And basically what he said was I need you.
Harry said we have white folks saving Black folks.
We don't have Black folks saving Black folks.
That's a problem.
We need to save our own people from hunger.
He was trying to get us the younger group, involved in what was happening in Africa.
I said of course.
It's not that I didn't have enough to do.
I was hosting the American Music Awards.
Had just been offered that invitation.
I'm about to go on my big solo tour.
The one thing for sure I knew, I wanted Quincy involved because he's the master orchestrator.
He's a successful performer, but he's better known as a producer and composer who's worked with everyone from Louis Armstrong and Frank Sinatra to Little Richard and Paul Simon to Diana Ross and Michael Jackson, Mr. Quincy Jones.
At that particular time, you could not be a producer and be any hotter.
He had the respect of every musician on the planet.
It'd been something I had been thinking about a lot before, Lionel called and he said, "Let's go."
You really had felt the need for that of all times, because this is the most the world's ever needed each other.
It started from there, and we went on to the obvious phrase of who's gonna do this thing?
Lionel and I got into his limo, which happened to have a phone in it.
I said, "let's get you and Stevie Wonder to write a song."
We called Stevie. We couldn't find Stevie.
Lionel continued to try Stevie all through the night.
They all wanted Stevie Wonder. Who wouldn't?
He already had that soulful, epic, legendary status.
And also they were all close with Stevie.
But when Stevie says, "I'll call you back,"
you just wait for him to call you back on whatever timetable it's going to be.
And after that, I had Quincy on the phone.
He says, "I'll see Michael tomorrow."
"I'll run it by him, see what he thinks."
The man whose record, Thriller, has just become the biggest-selling album ever, who earned more Grammy nominations this year than anyone in history.
Michael Jackson is the man of the '80s.
Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Jackson!
Michael and I go back to the early Stone Age days.
We were brought up in Motown, and, as lead singer of the Commodores and lead singer of the Jacksons, we bonded right away.
I've been working on this.
When he first learned how to drive, the first place he drove was over to my house.
But he couldn't drive on the freeway because he was scared to death, so he knew every backstreet in the world to get to my house.
But Stevie wouldn't call me back, so Michael and I needed to start writing without Stevie.
I said to Michael, "I can write the song by myself. You can write the song by yourself."
"But if we gonna do this together with Quincy Jones, it has to be huge."
This is my first time in the Jackson household.
That's when you do Vegas?
I realized we'd never written anything together, and we've never spent time together.
However you wanna do it.Doesn't bother.
There's a choice. I've got them.
This is the Sonny & Cher team, hear this.
I realize he can't play, so he hums every part.
Excuse me? It's just layered and layered of him humming.
It was pretty amazing.
We had to identify right away what kind of song do we want.
Do you want one of those? Or do you want an anthem?
No. That's not what we were looking for.
There it is. There's your template.
And once you have that, now what are we gonna put on top of it?
We went through various songs we thought were just sausage.
His line was, "Where's the jelly?"
He called me "Lion-el."
Lion-el, I want you to check out Bubbles the chimp.
I don't wanna hold the chimp.
Meanwhile, there's a full-on fight going on downstairs.
Shut up.
Shut up!
What's happening in the kitchen, Michael?
He says Ricky the mynah bird is having a fight with the dog.
Because the bird can talk, and the dog is mad at the bird.
Meanwhile, I've got someone calling on the phone.
Lionel, they're sending a script over for the American Music Awards.
Michael's, of course, working on his songs, and we're really not taking it that serious, because we'll get to it.
There are ways to make this thing bigger and bigger and bigger in terms of what it can generate, and, we didn't have a song, and we didn't have a date, but, because we had Stevie, Lionel, Michael, and Quincy, Ken realized that they had dynamite, and they could call anybody.
It would be epic.
Back then, we had no technology.
We didn't have cell phones.
Things didn't move quickly.
Thankfully, Ken's Rolodex was massive.
I used to travel with a gigantic suitcase that was just Rolodexes.
I said to Belafonte, "We oughtn't just limit this to the Black artists."
He said, "Sure. That's a good idea."
I said, "I represent Kenny Rogers who would, I think, do this in a minute."
Kenny Rogers was a really big deal, and we asked the other artists that we had on our roster, like Kim Carnes and Lindsey Buckingham, but any artist schedule takes months of planning.
Everything is a logistical nightmare.
Monday, it's the American Music Awards!
Three hot hours of the best of country, soul, and rock and roll!
Lionel Richie hosts the American Music Awards, live, Monday at 8/7 Central.
Because Lionel was hosting the American Music Awards, we looked at that date and realized that would bring so many artists into Los Angeles, expenses paid, plotted already on their schedules.
That was the pivotal point where it was like, "Who's coming to the American Music Awards, Larry Klein?"
Back then, the American Music Awards was a big fuckin' deal.
I had Diana Ross and Hall & Oates.
I had these people booked. Prince was, Madonna was, and Cyndi Lauper.
I'm currently after Hall and Oates.
Ken Kragen called me.
He said, "I wanna put together a group of superstars, as many people as I can get, to be on the song."
But to get these people in a room recording together, it had to be the night of the AMAs. There was no choice.
It was less than a month. We were looking at the top charts and saying, "Who could sell the most records?"
Please welcome his Royal Badness, Prince!
Prince was one that they wanted badly.
He had Purple Rain.
What are you looking forward to seeing in this film?
Prince.
Anything more specific than that?
Prince.
And anything else? Prince.
Prince was in love with Sheila E.
Sheila E!
She was his percussionist, and she was also a great singer.
I think we needed a little bit of everything.
Steve Perry, the lead singer of Journey, had the third-highest single.
I wanted Madonna.
Material Girl and all of the things she did would bring a really different audience, but Ken wanted Cyndi.
We had a fight about that.
Can you get my Barbie doll?
I felt it was an important thing to do.
I do believe that rock and roll can save the world.
Or we should try.
The next really critical move I made was to go after Springsteen.
Okay. This chair?
Okay.
We were very popular, and we had a great tour.
Springsteen was a rocket ship, but he wasn't going to the AMAs.
We called Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, and he said to me, "Look, he's finishing the tour the night before."
"He never, ever flies the day after a concert."
He said, "Let me talk to him, and we'll see."
Famine relief was important. I knew it hadn't been addressed, and you're always sitting there like, "What can I do about it?"
It was a little soon.
I normally wouldn't have done it, but it looked important.
Then it was like, "you have Bruce Springsteen."
"You could call Bob Dylan."
It was Bob Dylan.
Bob Dylan was known as the concerned musician.
He'd be a more natural fit than anyone, but the mid-'80s was maybe not the best period for him.
But he's Bob Dylan. He's an enigma.
Once Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen committed, it was just a wish list.
I know David Byrne was unavailable.
Van Halen was unavailable because they were on tour.
I wanted Bette Midler.
I wanted Dan Aykroyd.
How I heard about it was that Michael called me and said that he was planning on doing a big event and would I wanna be a part of it?
I wasn't that aware of what was going on in Africa, but at that time, whatever Michael did turned to gold, so, of course, it was a no-brainer.
Man, we got the most beautiful artists in the world.
Would be awful to produce the record with this many great people on it and it not work 'cause you don't have the right song.
We've got the cast now. Now we need a script.
Michael and I thought we had all the time in the world.
This project Kragen calls.
I can hardly sleep. I'm so excited about the project.
"Well," he said, "there are a lot of people waiting on this song."
"It's not just the four of you."
"Oh my God."
He said, "I think we have Billy Joel."
"And we got Willie."
"I think we have Tina. Huey Lewis, Paul Simon, Diana Ross, Ray Charles."
That's just pressure, pressure, pressure.
"And we're gonna do this the night of the American Music Awards."
"What are you talking about?"
And then Quincy comes by.
Yeah. Here we go.
So Quincy, very quietly, just said, "I need a song."
You have to understand the severity of this situation.
The American Music Awards are coming up next week, and Quincy has been basically rendered null and void until we have a song.
I don't know how it happened after that. We were just possessed.
Throwing things out and whatever felt good.
I came up with a few chords.
We now have a template with mumbles and no words.
"We are the world" was probably a line from Michael.
Out of the corner of my eye I see some albums falling over.
And I hear what the heck? What the hell is that?
I look over my shoulder.
There's the biggest frickin' snake.
Michael's going "There he is, Lion-el. Oh my God."
He lost the snake in the room.
He came out,when he heard us singing, Lion-el, and he wanted to meet you. He wants to say hello to you.
I gotta get outta here quick!
I am screaming.This is the end.
I saw this horror movie, and it's not good for the brother.
It was a very hectic lead-up to the recording session, and the location was a really big deal.
This paper is highly confidential.
The single most damaging leak of information is where we're doing this.
We scouted every single studio in Los Angeles, and A&M Studios had everything.
A great location.
The sound is phenomenal.
Done.
The moment that becomes public knowledge, if that shows up in the press, that could totally destroy the project.
The moment a Prince, a Michael Jackson, a Bob Dylan drive up and see a mob, they will never come in.
Kragen was really worried about this leaking, and they were so paranoid about it.
We've had numerous leaks of information regarding this event that have not made it any easier to do.
Did you ever trace where the leak was?
This was the biggest thing happening in pop music right here in town, so you couldn't keep it that big a secret.
Michael and I had finished writing the song, and finally turned it in to Quincy.
Does he like it?That's the first question.
Jesus Lord.
I listened to it at the house and absolutely fell on the floor.
I was so happy.Thank you, God!
He loves it. Okay. Now, we needed to put the demo down so that the rest of the artists will have an idea of what the song sounds like.
The other one.
My name is Humberto Gatica.
I was asked to be the engineer in charge of this entire project by Quincy Jones.
Hello?
Okay, so we've got Michael and Lionel over here.
We're getting ready to cut the track. We're gonna cut the basic now.
One, two, three.
The idea was to make something simple because it was all about the singing, about what these voices were gonna bring to this production.
Sorry, one more.
"It's true we make a better day." I love that, man!
It just seemed so natural to say "brighter" again.
You get a stronger feeling, though, if you use another word.
You think so? Yeah.
Right in the middle of the session, in walks Stevie.
He thought we were writing the song.
And so Quincy said, "I'll talk to him,"
and Quincy took him down the hall to tell him, "We've finished writing it."
We're already putting the demo down.
Of course, Stevie was, "Oh, okay".
You could see the shock was, "How come somebody didn't tell me?"
But, at that moment, the baby was about to get born.
Tomorrow, we gotta get lead sheets, a letter, and the cassettes out to all the artists.
Can I get it Monday sometime? Of course.
I must have my tape by tomorrow. It's imperative.
I got a stack of 50 cassette tapes that went to managers.
Some of them went directly to artists.
It was an interesting time. We had just had our first big hit record, and I received the tape, the cassette tape in those days, of the song and the invitation, and I played the demo in my car.
I'd never met Lionel or Michael, so,it was just an amazing invite to get.
I remember thinking, "Oh,this is gonna be a hit."
I remember how I heard about it 'cause Lionel called me.
Lionel was my brother-brother.
So that was it. That was enough for me.
I didn't have to be coaxed or anything like that.
Quincy's office sent me a copy.
I listened to it a couple of times, and it definitely had a memorable chorus.
When I first heard it, I thought it was very broad, as music that's gonna carry all those voices usually has to be, so I said, "Okay,that's cool."
In the letter that was sent out, one of the lines was blacked out.
That was where it was. It says that A&M studios.
Ken said, "No, you can't let anybody know it's there"
For him to give me details at that time would be unnecessary.
I, like many artists that I know, don't remember shit.
Quincy called me, and he said, "We're gonna do a new song, but I want you to handle the voices."
He said "Come on over. I wanna talk to you about it. We haven't got much time."
Quincy and I met back in 1973.
I was a white boy raised in a Black gospel church.
Quincy heard some arrangements that I had done for Sarah Vaughan, and he invited me to his home, and he came to the front door, and he looks up, and he goes, you're not white.
And that started us off.
We artistically fell in love and became brothers, but Quincy was the general.
We ended up at my house.
Tom Bahler was there, with Quincy, and they're in my living room.
They had a fan.
They had names of all of the artists on the floor.
Now, we have to go through the process of the arrangement of the vocals.
We had to select who's gonna do the solos, which only have a half a line to sing, and it has to be your sound, your style, your key in a half a line.
I started listening to every artist that was gonna sing a solo looking for differences, contrasts.
The Boss has a dirty sound.
And I thought of Kenny Loggins next.
Kenny has a clean sound that was perfect after Springsteen.
Bahler was studying people's vocal ranges because he wanted to make sure they would be really comfortable with what they had to sing.
Having worked with Tina before, I put her very low because she's got such warmth down there.
And then you go to Steve Perry.
His range,he's electrifying in that place.
Cyndi, her voice is forceful.
Even in Girls Just Want to Have Fun.
Oh God, I Love Huey, but not every artist was gonna sing a solo.
Also, he was worried about who they were gonna be standing next to, and that led to some interesting discussions about how people were gonna get combined.
I thought what we were gonna do was have everybody come in, one by one, go in the booth, sing it.
Quincy says, "No. We'll be here for the next three weeks."
"We'll put a circle in the room of all mics, and everyone will sing it looking at each other."
Some of these artists are troublemakers.
There were people in there, troublemakers. Cyndi Lauper was one.
Stevie Wonder is another one.
I'm not afraid, but it's just deep water, man.
Quincy said, "Let's start at the beginning."
What's gonna happen when they come in the studio?
We need to be able to handle whoever comes in, and we wanted no downtime.
This has gotta be seamless because if we stop for a minute, this thing's gonna be chaos.
I'm looking at these names. Great artists.
And I was one of them.
What am I doing?
It's pretty daunting.
And then, all of a sudden it's time.
I was at the Shrine Auditorium when Lionel arrived in the early morning.
Your artist is hosting the biggest prime-time show on a network, when network TV was the only thing that was happening.
We really worried about Lionel.
I tell you right now, there's more dialog than I've ever handled before in my life.
It's fun though. Lot of fun. It's always an exciting show, and I'm looking forward to it.
If I can stay awake!
But also, we have the setup for the studio.
I got the call to volunteer to light it.
I was able to get some friends in the lighting industry to volunteer, and I got the equipment for free.
To be honest with you, I don't think they even knew who was actually gonna come.
There was a lot of questions about artists who didn't come to the AMAs.
I was called by Quincy Jones.
All he said was, "You will be in Los Angeles tomorrow night?"
I said, "No, I won't. I'll be in Las Vegas."
Stevie was in Philadelphia, two o'clock, the day of the event.
We'll be seeing you in the summer!
Bruce Springsteen had just finished his tour in Buffalo.
I'd heard what the weather was about back there. So we got nervous.
You realize that you have no control of what's happening right now.
It was an evening where you're floating.
Hi, I'm Lionel Richie.
Tonight, we're back at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California for the American Music Awards!
Look out! We're gonna be running with the night! Whoo!
Lionel, that night, he had his responsibilities as a host.
He's the leader of the show.
Nothing will ever be the same after tonight.
He performed twice, and he swept the awards.
Lionel Richie!
Lionel Richie! Lionel Richie.
-Lionel Richie. -Lionel Richie!
-Lionel Richie. -Hello.
I think I won six awards that night while hosting.
I forgot, I'm working here.
When he was backstage, he was talking about We Are the World.
But you only got 30 seconds. Gotta be back on the stage.
1984 saw her explode into a solo career with her new album, The Glamorous Life.
Just wait till you see Sheila E.!
At that time, I was on the Purple Rain Tour.
It was nonstop.
By the time I got to the AMAs,I was delirious.
Sing it!
I was nervous as heck.
I looked into the audience, which is the wrong thing to do, because you look at the first five rows, you're like, "Oh my God!"
Come on, everybody, sing it!
I remember Lionel telling me, "After the AMAs, everyone's gonna go sing this song, and I want you to sing one of the verses."
So I was like, "Oh, absolutely."
Lionel had said he was hoping Prince would also sing a verse.
I was like, "Cool, but, you know, he's gonna do it on his own time."
And now, let's see what record will make it as Favorite Black Single.
Nominees are Prince, "When Doves Cry," Michael Jackson, "Thriller."
In a couple categories, it was Prince versus Michael.
The rivalry was real.
It would be great if Michael and Prince were together singing.
It was a great statement to make, that even these two guys, for saving lives, we can come together to do this.
When Doves Cry,Prince.
Prince, his bodyguard's name was Chick, and Chick was scarier than hell!
He was just a massively huge person, and when Prince would win an award, Chick would walk up onstage with him.
No one's gonna attack him walking up on stage!
Well, maybe that's different nowadays.
Outrageous!
Outrageous!
Prince won those big awards. Michael didn't.
Michael wasn't there of course. He was at A&M Studios doin' his thing.
There's a choice we're making. We're saving our own lives.
Could you just leave that line out of the chorus?
Can somebody bring me a lyric?
I'll leave it out, but I just might forget.
The first person who showed up here was Michael Jackson.
Put him right in the middle of that room. We're using a C12 microphone.
Can we take one?
He got himself that he felt that he was in sync with the music.
Could we just have balance before he holds the note from there?
Without the track? Sure.
I was here, adjusting some lights, and Michael Jackson is listening, and he suddenly sings.
This is the most remarkable voice, I have ever heard in my life.
Sorry.
I didn't say "better." I kept on saying "brighter" and "brighter." I forgot.
When I was asked to write this by Quincy about for world hunger, I put my heart and my soul into it.
It's so much easier for me to talk through the song.
That's really my statement.
- I like, "you and me." - Okay.
- It's much more soulful. - More soulful, yeah.
- Yeah. - Country, man.
That's what it's all about.
What was so interesting about Michael is that, originally, Michael only wanted to write a song.
At first, Michael didn't wanna sing or be on the video.
He thought it was overexposure at first.
I talked Michael into being on the thing.
That would've been one of the biggest mistakes of his career if he hadn't showed up.
But he was there, man. He was more than there.
How did it sound?Sounds great, man.
Fantastic, Mike.
Still to come, exciting performances by Tina Turner, Cyndi Lauper, and Prince.
Kenny Kragen was at the show, in the first row, and every time it went to commercial, Kenny leapt out the seat and ran backstage.
You stay in your seat, babes. You stay in your seat.
I went to him, and I said, "We have a situation happening here."
Cyndi Lauper.
Backstage, Cyndi Lauper came over to me and said, "My boyfriend heard the song."
"I'm not gonna be able to come, because he doesn't think it's a hit."
Nobody knew.
It certainly was a group of great people, but I was so punch-drunk tired.
Well, it's some year, huh?
And after the show, it was like, "All right, you have to just go there."
I said, "Cyndi, it's pretty important for you to make the right decision."
"Don't miss the session tonight."
What a night!
What a night!
I said to the artists, "Don't hang out here."
"Hit the road and get to A&M Studios."
Can you talk about your feelings about this record being made tonight?
I don't know what's happening.
Quincy's over there biting his nails. I wanna get over there and find out.
There's a rumor that Prince and James Brown may be included in this.
- No comment. - Why? Why not?
I'm not allowed to talk about it.
We have to move on. Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
When I left the AMAs, I just knew there was a car there for me.
And then we show up.
I had no clue who was gonna be there.
I knew nothing about what the project was till I got to Los Angeles.
Quincy means an awful lot to people, and when he's doing a project, it's something well worth being a part of.
Pretty much everything was ready to go.
Quincy asked me for a piece of paper, and he decided to write the greatest line.
Check your ego at the door.
I was lucky enough to be one of the cameramen, but I was just the rookie of the bunch.
I'd only moved out here three years before.
The producer said, "Go out front. They're gonna start arriving pretty soon."
The question is who was actually gonna show up.
We got Kenny Rogers coming in.
When I arrived at the studio, I realized it was the cream of the crop of pop music for that time.
Ray Charles, car coming in. Oh my God!
- Bette Midler. - I think it is.
- Christie Brinkley. Oh my gosh! - Anyone have eyes on Billy Joel?
It was overwhelming.
Walkie-talkies is how we communicated.
Who was showing up? Who was here? Who just got here?
Kim Carnes just arriving.
This guy pulls up across the street. in this old Pontiac GTO.
Guy gets out and it's Bruce Springsteen. I'm like, "Wow, it is on."
That's Ray. That's really him.
That's like the Statue of Liberty walking in.
To me, Diana Ross was like, "Whoa. We've hit a different echelon here."
I almost felt like I was in a dream.
Everyone was a legend to me.
Bob Dylan?I think I just said hi and walked away 'cause I was scared.
Nobody else was allowed in the studio except the artists themselves, so nobody had assistants.
And then, we get to interact with each other, and that was really the thrill.
It was intoxicating just to be around that group of people.
I felt like I was underdressed. I was worried.
I knew Billy Joel, so I went right over to him.
Everyone felt the magic. Everybody that you can think of who was in show business at that time is at that recording.
We're on the risers.
Paul is on one of the lower steps, and he looks up, and he goes, "Whoa. If a bomb lands on this place, John Denver's back on top."
It's beautiful. So beautiful.
We could feel the energy in the room was really high.
Ray and Willie are gonna do some singing.
But at the same time, under it is a low hum of competition.
The egos were still there. Let's not pretend that they weren't there.
Celebrities can be very difficult when they're surrounded by managers, agents, and glam squad, but they were not in that environment.
The biggest stars in music found it disarming.
They seemed almost timid.
It was like first day of kindergarten.
Okay, guys.
Can we have everybody clear out so we can make.
Listen. Guys.
Quincy had to pull all of these kids together.
First, I'd like you to meet Bob Geldof who is really the inspiration for this whole thing.
This is the man who put Band Aid together.
And he just came back from Ethiopia, and he'd like to talk to you.
Oh. Would I?
Put you in the mood of the song you're about to sing, which hopefully will save millions of lives, I think it's best to remember that the price for life this year is a piece of plastic seven inches wide with a hole in the middle.
I don't know if we in particular can conceive of "nothing."
But "nothing" is not having water.
On some of the camps, you'll see 15 bags of flour for 27,500 people, and you see meningitis and malaria and typhoid buzzing around in the air, and you see dead bodies lying side by side.
And it's that that we're here for, and I assume that's why we're all here tonight.
I don't want to bring anybody down, but maybe it's the best way of making what you really feel, why you're really here tonight, come out through this song.
So thanks a lot, everybody, and let's hope it works.
Quincy is so savvy.
He used the Geldof speech to get people to focus on what it was about.
"We're having a good time here, but I want you to put what you feel into the song."
I'd just performed at the AMAs.Everyone having a great time, and then the reality of him explaining why we're here, you just kinda go, "Wow."
Everything sung in this room will be unison, on each take, on harmony parts and everything, so we don't have to stumble with harmony inside the room.
The first thing I like to do is the lead to the choruses, okay?
Can we hear about four bars without but without the track? Acapulco!
Hold it, everybody.
If everybody could groove from their knees instead of their feet.
We're getting an awful lot of feet pounding on those risers.
The tension was there because we're not gonna have a lot of time.
Technically, we need to be really together, and we gotta move fast.
Once again, guys, please.
We had to learn the song.
You had to rough it out and go over it. And it was like that.
The pressure was on us, as the production group, to make sure, when we let Springsteen go home, when we let all these guys go home, it's done, right?
One night only to get this right.
Right, now, we'll do that all the way through, and up in the same octave as Michael's singing it.
Everybody that can't sing it that high, just lay out.
Just the high singers. I don't wanna get octaves on this part.
We're gonna do low octaves later.
If it's too high for anybody, they can just rest on the stack, and then we'll come back and put it away. Okay?
All right.
So we'll make a playback, and we'll start start chopping wood, okay?
Can I hear it?
Everybody have cans?
Bob Dylan knows himself, he's not a singer in the way that Stevie Wonder is.
So Dylan was probably more uncomfortable than any other person that was here.
Somebody's still singing an octave.
We really can't do the octaves on this take.
Just for them? Yes.
Some of the singers were saying, "That's not in my range."
Can't, right?
If it was out of your range, you're trying to figure out, "maybe I can sing a harmony," but they didn't want any of that.
They just wanted that solid unison.
There's a singers' old saying, "Suck along quietly."
Sing it while it's in your range.
When it gets out of your range, stop.
There are so many voices. Nobody's gonna miss you.
One, two, three.
There's probably 60 or 70 people in the room.
It was getting pretty ripe.
My lights were big 5,000-watt, fire-breathing instruments, so it got very warm in here.
And that added to the tension.
We had all the lighting guys and four cameramen, and so you had to be really careful to not get your cables tangled up and you had to be quiet.
Wait a minute.
Guys, you gotta keep it down. You gotta keep it quiet.
We gotta stop making noise in the takes, please.
We're shooting the video and putting the song together at the same time.
Can anything go wrong? Absolutely!
We were flying by the seat of our pants.
The clock is ticking. Quincy's worrying about the big picture.
My job was, if there was any problems on the floor, solve it.
Maybe a change.I think it should be "brighter."
I feel like everyone was singing "brighter."
This is "brighter"? -Not "better," "brighter."
Don't open a can of worms. Stay with "brighter."
Wanna do "better" or "brighter"?
"Brighter" is the one everyone's leaning to, right?
Lionel Richie is the guy to bring everyone together.
I'm walking around each little camp putting out fire.
He was on adrenaline.
He was just nonstop, but he's like that anyway.
He has stories to tell. "Let's do this."
"Let me tell you something." He's making people laugh.
He's just making the water flow in the right way.
One line you can never use in life.
"I'm not sure about this. What do you think?"
"Better" has more bite.
We have 47 artists.
If you say that, you'll have 47 different versions of We Are the World.
So my job was to make sure, under no circumstances, do we veer off what it is.
What are you doing?
What is it? What does it mean?
That's the translation for "We Are the World."
Stevie said, "I think we need to have some Swahili somewhere in the song."
I think we should sing.
What language? - Kiswahili.
Okay, thank you very much.
One, two, three, four.
If we do this, we're gonna run out of time, and if we run out of time, it won't be good.
I was in the corner of the room, happened to be pretty close to Waylon Jennings, I just heard him go "Well, ain't no good 'ol boy ever sung Swahili. Think I'm outta here."
"I think I'm outta here."
Waylon walks out of the door.
I'm not dealing with this. I don't know what that means, but I am not gonna say it,and we lost Waylon right there.
We're listening now. Listening now.
They don't speak Swahili.
You could see the potential for a 17-car linguistic pileup.
I just think that what you're trying to do is.
There's no point talking to the people who are starving, we're talking to the people who've got the money to give.
And, you know,if it turns on one person, it turns off two, maybe.
But what words do we use?I don't know.
If we don't have lines they speak Amharic.
The problem is we don't have any lyrics there.
I remember at that point because I'm shadowing Ray Charles, and Ray goes, "Ring the bell, Quincy! Ring the bell!"
Which meant, "Let's get going here."
A lot of people were getting kind of impatient about it.
Everybody's tired.
People wanted to get on and get it done, and I think that's kinda where "sha-la sha-lin-gay" may have come up.
I guess it was Michael's idea of how we can get something cultural sounding in here.
Hey. Excuse me.
One second.
Hold it!
What we're saying is, "because that's what we're giving."
What's what we're giving?
I'm one of the few people who'd say anything to Michael.
Doesn't make sense. "So let's start giving."
Yeah. "So let's start giving" would be better.
I've known Michael Jackson since he was ten years old when he first came to audition to be a Motown member.
He was singing and dancing his butt off at ten years old.
What do you wanna do?
Michael's one of the greatest artists we've ever had.
One of the greatest songwriters ever.
So people were afraid to say, "No, we shouldn't do that,"
or, "That don't sound good."
You tell me what "sha-la sha-lin-gay" means!
When you grew up in Motown, that's how we did each other, and we all love each other.
Does everybody like the lyric "one world"?
"One world." "One world."
"One world, our children. One world, so let's start giving."
Yeah.Everybody.
Please don't change it because my hearing's getting bad as well.
Let's put it on the tape! If you can, it's there.
Finally, we finished singing the chorus.
Quincy wants to say thank you to Harry Belafonte.
Remember the guy who started this whole thing, Harry Bela.
Then, all of a sudden, the most amazing thing happens.
Harry Belafonte was the most inspirational person for all of us who were there.
Al Jarreau started singing Harry Belafonte's song.
All of a sudden, everybody jumps in.
Thank you.
In between the breaks, Ray would play another version of "We Are the World,"
the gospel version, the "Georgia on My Mind" version.
And so, at that moment, I overhear Ray and Stevie talking.
And Ray says, "I got to go to the bathroom,"
and then Stevie said, "I'll show you where it is."
He just grabbed him by the arm and they walk, and everybody said, "The blind really is leading the blind,"
and we were all just bursting laughing.
Fish burger. Fish burger!
People were hungry.
Waffles are ordered in-house.
Chicken and waffles! Smothered chicken and waffles!
Everybody was ordering chicken and waffles from Roscoe's.
I never seen anybody who eats chicken better than Lionel Richie.
He eats the last little piece of bone.
He sucks it up, and he eats, and he puts them on top of the other one, so when he finishes, he has all these little bones all layered properly.
I said, "Brother, there's nobody that can eat chicken better than you."
When that break came, Diana walks up to Daryl Hall with her music in her hands and says, "Daryl, I'm your biggest fan."
"Would you sign my music for me?"
We all looked around and said, "Holy moly!"
Soon as she did it, it just started happening all over the room.
Seeing Cyndi Lauper asking Lionel or the Boss, that's dope that they wanna get each other's autograph.
And then, they come and ask me, and I'm like, "They want my autograph?"
"Wow, that's really cool," you know?
And so I called Prince to let him know how it was going.
I said, "I think maybe you should come."
"It's pretty cool, and everyone's hanging out."
We're having a great time.
I'm now on the phone with Prince.
He's at Carlos 'n Charlie's.
He said, "I want play a guitar solo." "In another room."
I said, "No,we're all in the same room."
"I need you to come and sing."
He wants to put a guitar, we just happen to not need guitar on it.
It was getting late. I was looking forward to singing one of the verses, but they kept asking, "do you think you can get Prince here?"
I'm like, "Wow, this is weird."
I just started feeling like,I feel like I'm being used, to be here, because they want Prince to show up, and the longer they keep me, maybe Prince will show up.
I'm sure they were waiting for his limousine to pull up, but he didn't show up.
I already knew he wasn't gonna come, because there was too many people, and he would feel uncomfortable.
I told Lionel, I said, "I'm gonna go."
They never intended on having me sing a verse, which was a little bit heartbreaking.
We had done the hook, so we're now going into the solos.
Two lines.
Michael came to me and said, "Prince isn't coming, so we have a spot on the line that needs a soloist."
"Who do you recommend?" And I said, "Huey Lewis."
Huey Lewis has a great solo voice.
Somebody tapped me and said, "Quincy wants you."
They brought me to Quincy. He says, "Smelly, come over here. Get Michael."
And he said, "Sing the line for Huey."
So now I get Prince's line. I mean, those are pretty big shoes to fill!
-Yeah! -Can I go now? Oh no.
From that moment on, I was nervous out of my brain.
Okay?
We got a line and waiting here.
By the time we really got down to do some solos, some people were asking, "Why does he have that part?"
Or "Why does she have that part?" And the answer was, "It fits their range."
You've got that line here.Let us realize Quincy told me who I was gonna sing with, and I said, "Willie Nelson?Interesting."
I was certainly surprised.
We all gathered around the piano, and Stevie Wonder's playing the song, and we sang it acoustically.
And Stevie Wonder, you could see the different voices register in his face.
About halfway through, as he's playing, he's going, "Wow. So many stars."
The first run-through around the piano, that's when we first heard what it was actually gonna sound like.
I'll never forget. It was amazing.
To hear all those personalities on that thing for the very first time on that song.
Hair stands up on my back just thinking about it.
We'd marked tape on the floor with the names, so it was a big U shape.
It started here and went all the way around.
I remember going through and counting them.
"Okay, there's gonna be three here, there'll be two here."
I'm looking at this list of names on the floor.
I'm like, "This is gonna be unbelievable."
Springsteen was here.
Testing, one, two.
I was right there.
Michael Jackson's right here. I sing right after Michael.
You know it's with me, right?
That circle was the intimidating circle of life.
Quincy was right.
When it's time for your part to sing, you are going to give 200% because the class is looking at you.
And to see everyone's preparation and vulnerability was pretty amazing.
You were on your game at that point.
What we do is we have mics in front of us, but what we'll do is you lean in on your part.
And then, when the other person comes in, when you duet with someone, whatever the case is, when your part comes up, lean in.
Don't sing back here. You sing back here, we'll never know your words.
Step in or lean? -Come on in.
Even though your name's back here.
-Do you follow? - Yeah.
This is real recording. It's just the names are back there, but the mics are up here.
Come to the microphone!
Let me know when you're ready! - Ready!
Can we do it again? I messed my start.
Stevie says he's messed up.
I was flat. I was so flat.
How flat is that?
Stevie messed up. How did he do that?
Is that legal? - Never!
Stevie screws it up playfully, as only Stevie can.
Kinda almost on purpose, kinda having fun with it.
Stevie was not nervous.
Never! I never mess my note.
It's my thoat.
Quincy raised his voice. "We gotta get you there!"
He screamed at us.
I'd never seen him like that.
Quincy,hey!
Quincy Jones was always very calm.
His only concern was time.
We got a lot to do. Still a long way to go.
- Can I help? -No,it's good!
It's tough.
Can I help?
That's my part.
He's talking about switching parts. I think I can do it.
Switch parts with me? Step back, sing louder.
Just hard to sing it soft.
It was 4 a.m. and they're singing their most important part.
So you're gonna get a little testy. You're gonna be a little tired.
Gives me a weird jump, though, after my melody, you know?
In my camera, they're huge because I'm just right there underneath them.
You could reach out, and you could touch that person.
They're just right there.
I was a big fan of Paul Simon.
Here he is, right here. He's singing in my face.
Kenny Rogers, when he hits that high note, and he just squeezes his face up, it's like, "God, he just".
At the time, I was thinking, "I can't believe people are paying me to shoot this incredible stuff."
Dionne Warwick's turn was up, and we had a little technical problem.
Yeah? Are you hearing your own voice?
Who is she? Get her outta here.
There was a little panic technically here.
We have some issue with some noise in the playback.
I said, "Whatever it takes, we gotta get this shit going."
We gotta take off again, no matter what.
- Is it still there? - Yeah.
Suppose it's leakage -Could be someone else's mic.
All the other tracks are off.
Then there's really no excuse for this.
Find out what the problem is.Shoulda used my studio.
Still hearing the other voice.
- Sorry. It's a mystery. - Ghosts!
- So who you gonna call? -Ghostbusters!
Aykroyd's in the echo chamber. - Aykroyd.
It kinda put a little tension.
It's gone.
We found it that time whatever it was.
It was a little tough, but we went right back into our plan, getting these vocals done.
It's getting to that time in the morning where we must be as accurate as possible.
Here we go.
Yeah.
It goes all the way through to Al Jarreau, who messes up, and so they go, "Boom," and so they start again.
It's Al Jarreau, he was a little over-the-top in the alcohol section.
I'm sorry.
That's Willie.
Al was interesting.
Okay, I gotta tell you the funny part about Al.
Al wanted to celebrate before we had done the song.
He kept saying, "Bring another bottle of wine in. We're gonna celebrate."
So every time another bottle came in, I took the bottle back out.
Stevie, can we have the keyboard first?
We're gonna have you rehearse that little part.
We had to work very hard to get Al's part on before Al couldn't remember what his part was.
Right. Yes.
Right. Again for me?
Just play the track. - Please.
That's enough.It's enough.
Every time they go back and rewind, it takes about five minutes.
So it's like you create a real tension every time you rewind.
What do I do after Bruce Springsteen?What would you do?
And then I went for a sweeter kind of soul thing.
Kenny Loggins was awesome, and they got to Steve Perry and Daryl Hall, and it was like, "Oh my God."
All right!
Steve Perry can sing. He's got that great voice, up in that Sam Cooke territory.
Gimme another one. Gimme at least two more.
These guys are getting three and four shots at their line.
Meanwhile, I'm over here on the end, and I haven't even sung my line yet, I'm freaked out.
I was watching all of these people singing.
I just was trying to remember to breathe.
I said to Quincy and Humberto, "Next time somebody screws up, can you just kinda keep going so we can rehearse our lines?
"And the bridge?"
And he goes, "Oh yeah, okay, cool," and Michael, who was next to me, says, "That's a good idea." I said, "Thanks, Mike."
- Go for the bridge? - You wanna go bridge?
To the bridge. Take me to the bridge.To the bridge.
To the bridge.The bridge.
Everybody to the bridge.
Okay, Huey. It's your turn.
You are effing ready to go home.
Just in case something might fuck up, and let it roll.
It was just one line, but my legs were literally shaking.
-Do you want that last one in harmony?
That's so good. You want to join her? The three of you join her on.
That'd be real neat.
But then they said, "Sing in harmony with Cyndi and Kim."
The demo didn't have any harmony parts or any I'm gonna have to make something up here.
Make up a three-part harmony in front of Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Kenny Loggins, Daryl Hall.
What am I supposed to sing?
That was very nerve-racking.
It's on "stand," isn't it? Yeah.
What's yours? What's yours, Kim?
I'm too burned out to tell anybody anything.
I'll try it. It's high for me, but I'll try it.
My fault. I was a bit out of tune. I didn't go down.
I thought Huey was gonna blow his head off.
Cyndi can sing octaves, and poor Hugh was hangin' on for dear life, so he couldn't take too many of those.
I sang it out of tune just to see if anybody would notice.
Cyndi absolutely killed that line, but there was something wrong.
Dude, listen to it. There's like harmonic things happening when she sings.
It almost sounds like conversation.
They kept saying, "What's that noise?" "What's that noise?"
Play back the first part of the other one, and then Humberto was going "we have so much noise on her track. What is going on?"
The mic is dying. You need to replace that mic.
No, the mic is beautiful.
The mic is beautiful?
There's nothing wrong with the mic.
The mic is beautiful.
Sounds like people are talking.
Or laughing or something. Every time you sing.
I don't think it's funny, and you should stop laughing when I'm singing because Cyndi, you have a lot of bracelets.
Oh, my earrings.
That did not occur to me.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, I'm loaded.
There goes the whole outfit!
No. I'm sorry.
That's the chatter. Okay.
That's the talking.
We needed that little moment of laughter to bring us back down before we rounded that corner.
Do the same punch,Huey. Right after Michael.
-Oh, I hung over too much? - No! That's gold.
You got that?
Because I devoted my whole life to singing, to be among those singers and actually be a part of their community was otherworldly.
If we leave Ray's hole open？ Yes. He's much older than me, you know.
This left Bob Dylan and Bruce doing the ad-libs.
Quincy called it "serious fills."
We're gonna do the serious fills now.
Bring it down a bit.
Here he is, Bob Dylan.
There's a choice we're making. Yeah. Okay.
He is a legendary, iconic symbol to Americans and the world.
Quiet, please. Here we go.
So we were expecting something amazing to happen.
Okay.
You got it. On a different track.
Okay,you have to run that.
Okay.back a lot of times.
I think he was a little confused because it just didn't seem like Bob was understanding how he was supposed to sing.
Is he supposed to be more like this chorus or more like Bob Dylan?
That's beautiful, and what's nice is you singing along with the chorus too.
That's the only time we do an octave.That's beautiful.
-I get out right after "me," right? -Just after "you and me."
The thing you were doing up there, singing along with the chorus.
"We are the children." That's nice.
Quincy was amazing.
- Okay. - That's beautiful.
Production is interesting. You gotta be more than a great musician.
You gotta be like a psychiatrist.
That's where he's going in on. - Stevie.Can he play it one time?
The secret agent to help him get comfortable was Stevie Wonder.
We're gonna rehearse it in here first.
Stevie is an insanely great mimic.
Stevie sang it ventriloquially in Dylan's voice.
Stevie's one of those guys, he can sing the phone book.
Anytime you're around him, you're around a genius, and he's also very sweet.
Here we go, Bobby.
Must be in a dream,right?
But at this point, there were a lot of people in the room.
Still photographers and others.
Having all these people around for Bob, it's not the way he normally works.
Now, here's what we're gonna do!
One last time, if you're not in Bob's group recording, please clear the room.
Then it just became Stevie at the piano and Dylan at the microphone and Quincy at his podium.
All right, man, let's do it.
I'm sorry. You did it.
That wasn't any good. I'm telling you, we got it.
That was fantastic.
If you say so.
I know you know.
I swear it is, man. It's perfect.
-All right. -Perfect.
Springsteen came in and said, "Nice, Dylan."
Called him Dylan.
I'd listened to Dylan,since I was a kid, and it was great to see him there and have a little interaction with him, so,it was fun.
Is that the part you're talking about? Great.
So this is the end, right?
This is we're in the end? This is the end of the song?
One, two.
There was very serious concern about Springsteen's voice.
I'll do a little bit. You tell me if it's.
Listen. It's like being a cheerleader to the chorus.
-Okay. -Know what I mean? "Come on!"
All right.
I was just on the Born in the U.S.A. tour.
I was pretty tired.
Quincy, you ready? -Yeah.
Here we go.
But I just started singing.
My voice was not great, but I sung as best as I could.
Did I get it right there?
- Okay. - Something like that?
Exactly like that.Okay.
We're gonna redo that track.
-Okay, here we go. -Right here and now?
Bruce is just quintessentially Bruce on that thing.
Sounds like he's got broken glass in his throat.
Thank you.
Broke a legitimate sweat, that did.
-Yeah.-You're officially on vacation.
-I can go home? - You're on vacation.
That sounds good!
All the hard work is done.
When it was over, we were exhilarated and exhausted to be sure. We'd been up all night.
But even then, on the evening, we'd done something that was gonna live forever.
Lionel, we've got good solos from everybody. It was perfect.
That's the bottom line. We feel the same.
Trying to get 40 superstars together in the same place at the same time is impossible really.
That's why, all of a sudden, when Springsteen said, "Right after my show, I'm coming to California."
Paul Simon, "I'm on my way."
Billy Joel, "I'm on my way."
In this room, this family grew.
However you feel comfortable.
You can do an aerial shot.
- Quince, where you gonna sit? - Right there.
here it comes.
The adrenaline just took the train.
The adrenaline just caught the bus.
They basically said, "That's it, guys. Wrap it up."
"Let's go home."
What a night!
I assumed this was a paying gig. At the end, when I'm getting ready to go, I had kinda like made up an invoice, and they go, "Invoice? There's no invoice! This was all volunteer."
"Everybody here is a volunteer." I went, "All right! Well, I got this cool T-shirt and a great story, so, okay!"
And Diana Ross stayed after everybody was gone.
I hear her crying.
Quincy said, "Diana, are you okay?"
She's like, "I don't want this to be over."
It was the sweetest thing I've ever heard.
I think we left about eight o'clock in the morning, and Quincy doesn't drive, so I drove him back to his place in Bel Air.
It was a kind of exhilaration mixed with exhaustion.
I remember Quincy saying like, "Man, those white boys really brought it."
I was exhilarated.
It's just like when you finish a concert, and you go home, and you're just like, "Yes,I nailed that."
You just feel good about it.
At eight o'clock in the morning, when I finally got home, I walk in the house, and there's my family, congratulating me on winning the awards and hosting the show, and all I could talk about was We Are the World.
They kept saying, "What are you talking about?"
They don't know what we're talking about. It was so big and so powerful.
That one night overshadowed everything that was going on in my life.
As you have heard on our own KFI News this morning and elsewhere, you have read and been told that, in about one minute's time, at 7:50, everybody in the world is going to be playing the same song.
Because of technology, we're talking about it reaching the ears of a billion people.
When that kind of energy gets thrown out, it's very powerful.
Music is a strange animal because you can't touch it, you can't smell it, you can't eat it or anything else, and it's just there.
Beethoven's Fifth just keeps coming back at you for 300 years, and that's very powerful, spiritual energy.
We Are the World was something that everybody could understand.
Even if you didn't speak English, you could understand the melody.
You could understand the feeling of the song musically.
This is an inner soul, an inner energy, that's coming from us that was much greater than any record any of us had ever done.
People can look at the song and judge it aesthetically, but at the end of the day, I looked at it like it was a tool.
It was a tool they were trying to accomplish something with, and, as such, it did a pretty good job.
I think every individual in the world wants to contribute, and they don't know how.
I got a feeling that we're creating a shift in what's going on in the world today, about helping other people.
It's compassion. It's real new.
The whole world singing your song. I mean, that's crazy.
In every language around the world.
It was one of those moments where you go, "Oh my God. What have we done?"
The single has already sold out its first million copies the first weekend it's been on release.
In the last month, America's children have made this record dedicated to Africa's children the fastest-selling single in US history.
I heard the song for the first time in my shower.
The record was amazing, and then my line came, and it was okay, and I was I am a part of something that has been life-changing, and it's very humbling.
The collective power of artists can be very impacting.
If we all put our egos aside in the service of people in the world who are less fortunate.
We're truly all one people.
We are all in need of each other.
This is the realization of the dream of USA for Africa.
This is the beginning of the second phase of our activities, feeding people and saving lives.
I take it one at a time. Whether we can feed one person, or we can feed one million, the point is to get in.
The ripple effect that We Are the World had was that everyone wanted to try and do it.
An artist suddenly realized that they could now make a change in the world.
It's one of those things that kids who haven't even been born yet will know about because it was a unity through music.
Your turn to sing!
My dad said something to me years ago.
He said, "Enjoy coming home,"
because there's gonna come a time when you can't go home.
I said, "Dad, what does that mean?"
He said, "the house will be there."
"The people in the house won't be there."
This is that room.
That's the board. It's right in there, and Humberto's not sitting behind it.
Michael Jackson was right there, in this room.
Springsteen did his part right over there in that corner.
And Cyndi Lauper was right here.
It's very special.
I think about this room as my house.
This is the house that We Are the World built.
Core and countdown one in two hours, 57 minutes.
Copy.
Dragon's healthy and ready for crew ingress.
You're looking at the rocket that will return American astronauts to the International Space Station from American soil for the first time since nearly nine years ago.
Today's mission is known as Demonstration Mission-2, or Demo-2.
Demo-2 is the final test for NASA to certify?SpaceX for regular crew flights to the space station.
Core and countdown one in T-minus two hours and 46 minutes.
The crew has arrived at the White Room. Its ingress is in progress on schedule.
Dragon has transitioned to terminal count and is on internal power.
Stage one locks load, close out.
Earth is the cradle of humanity, but you cannot stay in the cradle forever.
It is time to go forth, be out there among the stars, expand the scope and scale of human consciousness.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
There's this little candle of consciousness on Earth.
It hasn't been around for very long, and it could easily go out.
It could be a meteor, extreme climate change.
Who knows? A third world war.
Clearly, we need to preserve the light of consciousness into the future by becoming a multi-planet species, extending life beyond Earth.
Before starting SpaceX, I was waiting for NASA to send people up to Mars.
Every year, I'd look at the NASA website, and I was like, "Well, it's hard "
There just didn't seem to be a date for when we're sending people to Mars.
In fact,space, you could say, "Look, we were able to go to the Moon in '69, and our last mission to the Moon was in '72."
"And now here we are half a century later, and still we have not gone back to the Moon."
The absolutely fundamental breakthrough that's needed for humanity to become a multi-planet species is a rocket system that's fully and rapidly reusable.
For 50 years, NASA has been left behind.
As the NASA administrator, I will tell you, that is a failure of our nation.
But now, through our partnership with commercial companies like SpaceX, we have the opportunity to fix that.
If Mission Demo-2 is successful, we'll launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil for the first time in nine years.
The ability to once again send our astronauts to the International Space Station is the first step in getting humans ready to go to Mars.
Good morning, safety divers EV-1 and 2. How do you copy?
Copy safety divers EV-1, copy safety divers EV-2, going to backup.
 Five GPH and work on the blue.
Alarms have been enabled, and we show no alarms that impact testing.
Hey, Bob, you're gonna need a Bravo 7.
Okay.
Bob and I, we're laser-focused on what we need to do to get Dragon safely to Space Station and then,our mission on board Space Station after that.
We've been close friends since we started as astronauts almost 20 years ago.
-That feel better? -Yep. That's good.
Doug's a meticulous pilot and extremely skilled at the same time.
It's a rare person that kinda can put both skills together where not only are they super good, but they're also super good at staying out of trouble.
He's a Marine, right?
So he does have some of the stereotypical things about a Marine, so you need to know that.
Everything has a place, and I like things organized and symmetrical, Bob's just he doesn't have time for that stuff.
It's just an override. It allows you to bypass.
He's got a tighter sense of hygiene than I do, I think.
"Do you really want it cleaned that well?" "Yes, I do."
Try to give you as much flying as possible today, just to show you Bob's got an incredible mind.
He's just always a little bit ahead of everybody else.
He's very analytical,?very mechanical, which I think is why he's been such a successful spacewalker.
He pictures it, yet he has the ability, mechanically, to do those things.
I'll just get to another handrail over here.
Bob expects a lot out of himself.
We set pretty high bars for ourselves and each other.
You got a lot you need to get done, and there's a lot of people that are counting on you to get it done.
How confident are you that we'll see humans launch from US soil this year or in the summer?
It's been 17 years, and we still haven't launched anyone yet.
But hopefully, we will later this year.
Seems like you're feeling good about flying on it.
I think this is what you wanna see.
You wanna see the team hitting its stride, as we get ready to put people on these things.
Elon, you've got these two guys sitting right next to you.
Any thoughts on that, how you're gonna get through that launch?
I suspect it'll be extremely stressful, but we've been very focused on just making sure that the vehicle works.
We definitely won't launch till we've done everything we can possibly think of, that's for sure.
We are doing everything we can to make these vehicles as safe as possible, because my generation,we remember a catastrophe.
I remember exactly where I was in 1986 when the Challenger exploded.
I was in Miss Powers' fifth grade class.
This was the mission with Christa McAuliffe, a teacher going into space.
They brought in the TVs.
Challenger, go with throttle-up.
What appears to be a major catastrophe in America's space program.
Challenger, only seconds after leaving the launchpad, has exploded in midair.
No word yet on if there are any survivors.
Spaceflight is an unforgiving environment.
You're riding a controlled bomb into space, and you're accelerating to 17,500 miles an hour.
Obviously, there is inherent risk.
With all of our experience on the NASA side, having dealt with the risk, Doug and I were a good fit, I think, for SpaceX.
That experience with the actual loss of a crew was something that they felt was important for the crew members that were gonna work on developing a new vehicle.
Do you do it on the back one normally, Bob?
Bob and I have been working with SpaceX for five years.
We're involved with the design.
And, of course, one of the things that we wanted Dragon to have that shuttle didn't have is the abort system.
If something goes really, really wrong we'll be automatically separated from the booster and parachute back down into the Atlantic.
Today is the uncrewed test of this abort system.
Good morning, everybody. We are now actually live.
It's awesome, but I'm also just a little bit sad.
I don't wanna see a rocket intentionally blow up and sacrifice itself for the safety of humankind's going to space, but sometimes, that's what you gotta do,so I've been doing this full-time on YouTube for almost three years.
I'll move closer so you have a sense of scale.
The point of Everyday Astronaut is to bring space down to Earth for everyday people.
We're gonna be trying to track the rocket with this.
Thirty-five percent of my audience is in the United States Sixty-five percent is an international audience.
And so spaceflight is literally uniting people around this common goal of space exploration.
It's not just one person or one country. It is humanity.
You're exploring together.
T-minus ten.
Five, four, three, two, one, ignition.
Look at that!
We are in this. We are doing this.
Yes!
Yes! Look at that!
Car alarms are going off!
Those clouds might ruin our shots here.
Here we go. It's gonna happen right now in the clouds.
No!
We have to watch SpaceX's stream.
Vehicle is supersonic and passing through maximum dynamic pressure.
Dragon launch escape initiated.
Dragon's away.
Okay, the major activity coming up.
Okay, you just saw a bright flash there.
It looks like Falcon 9 breaking up.
And there they are. Drogue chutes are out.
Another amazing milestone is complete.
This was a very successful test.
It looked beautiful.
Yeah, obviously, I'm super fired up. This is great, you know?
I was wondering how much data you were able to get after the breakup.
We lost telemetry on the first stage shortly after it exploded.
There's definitely not any big pieces of the rocket left.
Hi. Loren Grush with The Verge.
The explosion that happened today with the Falcon 9, what would happen if an explosion like that occurred while the Crew Dragon was still attached?
 Is there any concern about that happening?
It's much more a fireball than it is an explosion.
It should be,really not significantly affected by a fireball.
So it could quite literally, like something out of Star Wars, fly right out of the fireball.
Obviously, we wanna avoid doing that well, thank you, all.
Elon, doesn't this deserve a dance today?
I can't set these expectations of dancing constantly.
I'm not that good of a dancer. You are!
-I'm gonna have to work on my skills. -You are.
No, I am not your dancing puppet.
I'll tell you what, after crew launch, 100%.
All right, it's good to see everyone.
What we did this morning was almost a final exam for the system we're gonna fly here in a very short time.
There's certainly a fair amount of work left to do.
We've got final simulations.
But just to see the in-flight abort and think about flying rockets again to the space station, it's unbelievable.
I mean, nine years ago, I was the pilot on the last shuttle flight.
At that point, I didn't know if I was ever gonna fly again.
We're about to see something that none of us will ever see again, the launch of a space shuttle.
On the 135th and final space shuttle mission, the shuttle program coming to an end after 30 years of flight.
Space shuttle spreads its wings one final time for the start of a sentimental journey into history.
Houston station, Atlantis on the big loop.
 Flying high over the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Africa, as we watch Doug Hurley up on the flight deck of Atlantis.
I remember the last night we were in space.
Right before I went to bed, just looking out the overhead window of the shuttle you could just see, I mean, literally see out into the galaxy.
And to see what's over that next bend and around that next curve is why I originally got into this business.
Knowing it was the last flight of the shuttle, just looking out and thinking about what was gonna happen after that, it was pretty tough.
With its signature sound of twin sonic booms piercing the predawn sky as the space shuttle announces its arrival at the launch site, having gone subsonic for the last time.
Hurley now deploying the drag chute.
Hey, thanks to you and your team, Mike.
Until the very end, you all made it look easy.
The shuttle's always gonna be a reflection of what a great nation can do when it dares to be bold and commits to follow through.
When I became Deputy Administrator of NASA, anybody who looked at it knew that we had to retire the space shuttle program.
It was very expensive.
You know, we had already spent hundreds of billions of dollars building it and keeping it going.
And it was also dangerous.
We'd lost astronauts twice.
To replace the shuttle, we ultimately ended up launching with the Russians in Russia.
The American space agency signed a new contract.
The US will pay about $82 million to Russia for every astronaut on board a flight to the International Space Station.
On the New York media tour, Stephen Colbert asked the crew, "So what would you tell a kid today growing up who wants to be an astronaut?"
And Sandy Magnus answers, "Learn Russian."
 Three, two, one, zero.
Oh goodness.
The end of an era in Florida.
One of Cape Canaveral's most storied launch sites was imploded this morning.
Forty years of space history is being dismantled and demolished, just one more sign that human spaceflight is coming to an end.
It was really a tumultuous time,especially for the astronauts.
Things were changing pretty drastically, and we weren't really sure kinda what was gonna happen.
We needed something very different, so we had to create a new program, which required turning to the private sector.
We will partner with industry, we will invest in cutting-edge research and technology, and by 2025, we expect new spacecraft designed for long journeys to allow us to begin the first-ever crewed missions beyond the Moon into deep space.
And a landing on Mars will follow.
And I expect to be around to see it.
Thank you.
I thought tapping into the private sector was really a symbol of innovation.
Of course, there were a lot of questions and concerns.
Like if companies are on the Moon, does that mean they own it?
So I thought we'd need new laws, but I was pretty sure that the private sector would get us over the hump.
Getting everybody to agree was the challenge.
I want order in this hearing room.
I find serious flaws in the president's proposal that relies on a still-developing commercial sector that may not be able to deliver.
Safety has been You know, change is hard.
The relentless momentum of the status quo of a tens-of-billions-of-dollar government program is a lot to overcome and people went batshit crazy on us.
The proposal by the administration is a bad idea.
In a word, devastating.
Many of the companies are start-ups.
We're not sending cases of Tang into space.
Future generations will learn how the Chinese,the Russians, and even the Indians took the reins of human space?exploration away.
The industry feared new entrants.
You're in the club if you're a big aerospace company.
There's a lot of revolving doors between astronauts who then go to companies, and it became us versus them.
I want to welcome Mr. Neil Armstrong,who was commander of Apollo 11, Eugene Cernan, who was commander of Apollo 17.
And we will start with you, Mr. Armstrong.
There will be overlooked requirements and unwelcome consequences.
This proposal has no focus and in fact, a blueprint for a mission to nowhere.
You had to hold me down in my seat.
And I was not the only one.
I was very sad to see that.
Those guys are heroes of mine, so it's really tough.
They inspired you to do this, didn't they?
Yes.
And to see them casting stones in your direction.
It's difficult.
I wish they would come and visit and see what we're doing here.
And I think that would change their mind.
Why is this not working?
I've worked for SpaceX for years now.
Can't turn it on.
And in that time, of course, SpaceX has had lots of successes.
Come on.
But also, you know, it's had its fair share of failures.
For many failures that we had, I felt like we could have done better here or there.
But this is what the business is, right?
You make mistakes, and you fix them the next time.
Okay, you see it works.
The great thing about Elon is that he understands that failure is part of the development, and he's been that way ever since the day I met him.
I decided one day to go to an amateur rocket weekend.
All right, let's go. Let's go fly.
We ran into Elon Musk there and talked a little bit about rockets and plans what to do.
And then he asked me if I'd be interested in working at a company to build a rocket and go to Mars.
If you say Mars in Germany, people will just laugh at you and think you're crazy.
It took me ten milliseconds to just say yes.
In a warehouse near the Los Angeles Airport, Musk and his staff are building a rocket they call the Falcon.
Musk is no rocket scientist.
He's a dot-com millionaire many times over.
Now he says he can do?what NASA has not, jump-start the space age.
I had somewhere in the order of 100 million to invest and thought we could at least do some good for the advancement of space exploration.
Falcon 1 is expected to launch this fall.
Elon Musk's fortune will be riding on it.
Hans introduced me to Elon.
And I'd been in this industry for 15 years, and I saw what could be done and wasn't being done.
And I really felt like, if anyone was gonna break through the mire of a very bureaucratic industry, Elon and SpaceX was kind of the last opportunity.
These are dispersed rocket parts.
Parts for the stages, parts for the engines.
I remember the early days of SpaceX.It was a small team.
But when you can all rally around one project, magic can happen.
We were all focused on exactly the same thing, getting Falcon 1 to orbit.
On the fuel side, we're gonna add a port rather than mess with the valve.
So we'll just designing an orbital rocket, it's not the mad scientist, like, "Yeah, I've got the idea."
It's just a monumental amount of work.
Everything, the engines, software, hardware, down to the nuts and bolts, was redesigned for the modern era.
It's extremely difficult to build a rocket from scratch.
Falcon 1 is a two-stage rocket.
Basically, the rocket launches, and the first stage burns out.
The two stages separate, and the second stage ignites to get to orbit.
And rockets?are unforgiving.
One design error,and everything is over.
At that point, I was not sure whether success was even possible.
I told the team I'd have enough money for three flights, and then that'll be it, you know.
Curtains if we didn't make it in three flights.
We understood what was on the line.
So we worked on it for four years.
I had no doubts ever.
I was just so focused on building the company and getting the rocket to fly.
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Plus one, plus two, plus three, plus four, plus five, plus six, plus seven, plus eight, plus nine, plus ten.
This is the LC on the countdown net.
Falcon 1 is airborne at this time.
We have a loss of signal there.
About 30 seconds after liftoff, the engine shut itself off.
The really hard part was collecting the pieces the next day.
We'd worked on it for years, and suddenly everything was over.
I came back home after a couple days, and my wife told me I did not talk at home for two months.
It took me so long to just get over this and then continue working on rocket number two.
Five, four, three, two, one.
A year later, our second attempt failed.
And the year after our second attempt, our third launch failed, and we knew the company was in a bad place.
We were running on fumes at that point. We had virtually no money.
That was definitely the worst year of my life.
And I never thought I was someone who could ever be capable of a nervous breakdown, but I felt this is the closest I've ever come, because it seemed pretty dark.
I was pretty depressed at the time.
You know, three failures in a row, wasn't really a testament of great engineering.
Elon pulled us in a big conference room, and I expected him to say, "you guys suck,"
and stop it at this point, but he was just the opposite.
He was actually saying, I want you guys to fix everything and launch another rocket as fast as you can.
He put all the money that he had into SpaceX and was doubling down,basically,on this.
I didn't expect that.
T-minus 30 seconds.
Deck one is triggered.
I knew NASA was watching our flights, and so we needed to get Falcon 1 to orbit to prove that we could earn the right to work with them.
I think Elon was even more nervous,than I was.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
We have liftoff.
Oh fuck.
Come on, baby.
Please tell me that's second-stage lights.
-Fuck. Thanks. -We're already 2B.
Thank fucking God.
I mean, whatever.
Thank whoever. Fuck.
Come on. Just fucking hold, you fucker.
It's hard getting to orbit, but we learned a lot on flight one, we learned a lot on flight two, and we learned a huge amount on flight three.
And we were ready to fly.
Second stage approaching SECO.
And that would be a nominal SECO which means Falcon 1's the first privately developed launch vehicle to reach Earth orbit from the ground.
This is one of the greatest days of my life, and I think probably for… for most people here.
We've shown people we can do it, and this is just the first step of many, ultimately getting to Mars.
And I think the future of SpaceX is really great.
In the history of spaceflight, only four entities have launched a space capsule into orbit and successfully brought it back to the Earth, the United States, Russia, China, and Elon Musk.
NASA called and told us that we'd won the $1.5 billion contract.
And I couldn't even hold the phone.
I was like I just blurted out, "I love you guys."
SpaceX again successfully launched its Falcon rocket.
Today will be the fifth Falcon 9 launch.
Today we'll be placing a communication satellite a TV satellite into space.
23 satellites, geostationary orbit.
SpaceX plans to launch a dozen commercial satellites a year.
SpaceX may be in the lead to win NASA's confidence, but SpaceX isn't alone.
You're creating, like, spaceships. Yeah.
Yes!
Musk and Bezos are dueling for contracts to supply the International Space Station.
The third space billionaire, Branson, wants to create a space tourism industry for hefty fees.
You wouldn't imagine that something shaped like that would fly so gracefully and so beautifully.
Somehow it all seems a little less noble than in the early days.
Perhaps space travel today is all about money and ego.
Thanks for not lighting this place on fire.
You're welcome.
How does one decide to just make a flamethrower?
I'm a big fan of Spaceballs the movie, and in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have a flamethrower.
Spaceballs the Flamethrower!
The kids love this one.
Does anybody tell you no? Does anybody go, "Elon, selling a flamethrower, the liabilities"?
It's a terrible idea. Terrible.
I said, "Don't buy this flamethrower. Don't buy it."
Still, people bought it. I just couldn't stop them.
Elon,he's gonna do what he's gonna do.
I mean, he has an Iron Man suit in the middle of the factory floor.
How does it work?
Do people get upset at you if you do certain things?
There's tobacco and marijuana in there. That's all it is.
Oh, here we go. Elon Musk back making headlines.
That is his specialty.
Elon was out there,creating lots of stories.
And so I didn't have any reason to believe at first he'd be the one.
Now he took a lot of heat for smoking marijuana on camera.
He was ridiculed for his wild middle-of-the-night tweets.
What is going on with Elon Musk?
He's an eccentric billionaire, I suppose. So an eccentric sense of humor as well.
He's a human, just like the rest of us.
We all have our pluses and minuses.
To be out there among the stars,I find that incredibly exciting.
That makes me glad to be alive.
But I don't think it has anything to do with individual antics or individual wealth.
This is a much greater vision that he has for not only society but the planet.
That hasn't changed.
And he demands a lot of everyone around him, I think as much as he demands out of himself, but he's relentless.
You decided to build a space company.
Why on Earth would someone do that?
Got that question a lot. That's true.
The big innovation is still ahead, and you're working on it now.
Tell us about this.
The goal of SpaceX is to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a spacefaring civilization, which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket.
The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket.
But even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time.
So it's possible to achieve, let's say, roughly a hundredfold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket.
A general estimate of how much we have spent in human spaceflight since Apollo is around $350 billion, and we send about 350 US astronauts to space.
So it's about a billion dollars a person.
So being able to lower that cost is just such an obvious goal, or you're never going to go anywhere.
In order to make spaceflight cheap, and in order to land on Mars and do all these things, you have to have a fully reusable rocket.
It's really common in space movies and science fiction to see.
Retros on!
The sci-fi vision of the rocket that can take off and land anywhere.
That's so far away from what was even considered possible.
That's really, really hard to do.
In fact, no one had ever tried to land an orbital booster.
Landing a rocket certainly seemed absurd when we first started trying it.
To get it right, you have to set down this thing that is the size of a skyscraper and weighing 30 tons and land it on this speck in the middle of the ocean.
At any point, any part of that can go wrong, and it'll only end one way, which is in an explosion.
SpaceX is not afraid of failure. They almost embrace failure.
"Hey, we're gonna test this. It might blow up."
"If it blows up, we'll learn something."
The way a traditional partner with NASA works, everything all along the way is qualified before it ever gets on the vehicle.
SpaceX does things very differently.
The two philosophies couldn't be more opposite.
You'll see NASA literally solving everything on paper, and SpaceX is literally building stuff, seeing what breaks, and then iterating from there.
They're developing a rocket around those explosions.
That's why it's important to have a lot of launches and make a lot of rockets.
Every rocket, every launch is an opportunity to improve.
Obviously, we get unhappy about failures that we have, but we also are pleased with the results that come out of failures.
You never know your system until you've pushed it to the limit so that it breaks.
One of the reasons people had imagined reusable rockets but had never achieved it is that we'd never cracked precision landing.
After the rocket launches, the booster stage separates and then flips around to shoot back towards Earth.
So we had to figure out how to get a rocket that's moving seven times the speed of sound back to its target.
First, we developed the legs, the engines, the actuators and sensors, and some very advanced algorithms.
Finally, we added grid fins.
By rotating these fins, we precisely guide and fly the rocket back to the target.
At the very last minute, we light the engines one more time for the landing burn to slow the rocket all the way down for landing, hopefully right in the middle of the X.
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Liftoff of Falcon 9.
Falcon 9 has cleared the tower.
 Stage separation confirmed.
The first stage is returning to land.
Stage one landing burn. Stage one landing burn.
Thousands of people worked on the booster landing.
Seven years was entirely about getting that booster to land.
When that thing finally came down and did a picture-perfect landing right on the target, it's just one of those moments that you will carry for the rest of your life.
-It's standing up.-It's standing up.
Oh my God.Look at this. It's just sitting there.
Holy smokes, man.
To see them doing this over and over and over and hitting these bull's-eye targets, it's just an absolute testament to the engineering involved.
Elon and SpaceX changed our industry completely.
Because everything is reusable, they can now launch for a tenth of the cost that we had, which saves a lot of tax dollars.
Launching in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic, it's been a challenge.
But we're gonna persevere through this.
We're gonna get Bob and Doug safely to the International Space Station.
Because this mission to once again launch our astronauts from American soil, it's really about hope.
It's about looking up and saying, "Look, we can still do amazing things, even when we're being challenged in ways that we've never been challenged before."
Bob and Doug are going into quarantine with their families in the lead-up to launch day.
This quarantine period is normal for any launch.
Though I guess not much will change for them since they've been in some form of quarantine since March.
We entered the quarantine period, so it's hands-off to the rest of the world until we get back from the International Space Station.
-How's it look? -Looks good to me.
I'm guessing we're not gonna have this on Space Station, right?
Everything that you know and love is down there, and you're up here.
And then hopefully everything will work so I can get back down there, uh, to see 'em again.
Mom, you're walking. I thought we I'm gonna catch you.
I wanna make sure that I focus on my family, you know, this being kind of my last opportunity.
Yeah, I might be living up there in two weeks.
Remember when you saw Mommy on this thing?
Yeah.
Probably nobody knows more about what the astronauts are going through, of course, other than another astronaut.
Copy.Nice silhouette on the door.
Bob and I, you know, we're both married to astronauts.
My wife, Karen, she's got two flights.
After my shuttle flight to the space station, I was not fulfilled completely.I wanted more.
And so I went back up there for six months.
Hey, you guys.
-Hey, you guys. Good to see you. -Hey.
Every day was varied, but the main objective was to conduct science in a zero-gravity environment.
I mean, the station is basically a huge laboratory that's built in space.
Any experiments where we interacted with the researchers on the ground, that was always fun?because you could just feel their excitement and how these experiments help to figure out what's happening on Earth.
Because of the tremendous amount of time Karen was on board the ISS, there were people years later saying, "Hey, I found your wife's hair up here."
I'm like, "Well,sorry."
What a beautiful spaceship we're on, guys.
My wife, Megan, flew on a space shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.
Clear the pin. Five seconds, the mode switch is in auto.
Three, two, one, release.
My mission was the final servicing and repair mission for the telescope.
We would joke and say, "We're helping to unlock the mysteries of the universe,"
but it really is true.
So whenever I see an article in the paper where a group of scientists have discovered something new, I always think, you know, "Hey, you helped a little bit with that."
Before any of us actually got into space, Bob and Megan and Karen and I, we were all classmates.
And so we spent a lot of time together.
So far, so good on the ascent of the space shuttle Atlantis on this its 22nd mission, the 99th flight in space shuttle history.
One of the astronauts from the class ahead of us hosted a party to celebrate the incoming class, and I first met Doug at that party.
We were friends first.
It took a few years to become more than that.
Yeah, I think we were lucky, though, to find each other.
I remember actually the first time I really heard about Bob.
We each received kind of this pamphlet that showed everyone's picture and, like, a two-sentence bio.
He was born in this year, and he graduated in this year, and he got a PhD by this year.
He's got to be some kind of child prodigy.
And he said, "Well, there's actually a typo in there with the dates,"
but I think you'll find that he is a prodigy.
But over time, I think it became clear that we were gonna build a life together.
Had a chance to come out to the old astronaut beach house today.
I'm really looking forward to spending some time with my family out here before launching on Dragon in just a few short days.
I think the thing that's most important to us right now is that we are living every day normally.
We're just enjoying time together as we get closer and closer to launch.
Blastoff!
That was our new DM-2 tradition with our sons to launch rockets from the beach.
Thank you.
As we approach liftoff, I'm just kind of feeling sort of joy tinged with terror, I guess is the best way that I can describe it.
It's like every other trip, over-packing.
Being the person?watching,  especially having been a crew member, it's all out of your control.
There's nothing you can do other than watch, and it's definitely a lot harder.
-None of these I would ever want. -You gonna grow a mustache?
The best your family can do is break even, right? You come back.
-Never want a what? -Never had a mustache.
I have wrestled with that.
But in the end, ultimately, you want your child to understand that during your life, there are things that are risky, but if it results in a better world, maybe it's worth that risk.
So what you're looking at here is our main stage for the launch broadcast.
We've got three cameras, then what you don't see is the fourth one.
-We'll have a jib out here as well. -Okay.
They're putting together a Launch America banner that will be brought up directly behind our hosts.
Behind that, you'll get a little NASA in there.
You'll get a little of the American flag in there as our backdrop.
So you got layers of depth to work with, which is kinda nice.
And where we go from here is the full dress rehearsal, as if it were live.
This is the point when the launch escape system is armed, and that happens just before SpaceX begins fueling the Falcon 9 rocket at T-minus 35 minutes.
As a reminder I'm gonna interrupt Lauren because it looks like we've had some type of anomaly on the pad.
We have a developing situation with our launch operations.
We've taken a pause for our NASA and SpaceX teams to gather information.
We are not going away.
We're gonna stay here on this pad shot, so please stay with us.
Would we really hold on the disaster?
In terms of what, when you say hold?
Would we just watch it like, if it's a flaming mess, we just watch the rocket explode?
So depending on when and how it plays itself out, we'd probably be cutting to a wide shot and watching this thing happen.
Can we cut to a control room or something?
We couldn't cut away.
-Okay. -Yeah.
Static fire happening right now.
So it looks like they have had successful static fire of the rocket.
That's where they hold the rocket down and actually light up its engines to make sure all things are good to go.
And it looks like that has gone smoothly.
This is my sign.
This is when I was gonna hit the road, because that means they're still on track to actually be launching here.
I have to pack masks. It's a freaking pandemic.
This is the actual warning label, like on the International Space Station, the hatches.
I mean, even space underwear.
I'm a nerd.
Now, with humans flying, starting to get a little nervousness because I have watched rockets fail.
Just today, Virgin Orbit had their first orbital launch attempt, and it failed.
And it sucks. Space is hard.
There's still so many moving parts, and there's so many things that can go wrong.
And, of course, I have a lot of confidence in the systems, but There is a real sense of importance.
There's a real sense of danger now.
It's getting a lot more real now.
With primary day tomorrow, it's looking a little wishy-washy.
All the models are showing some isolated storms just west of the staging area.
Yeah, you can see the map. That's the front approaching.
Looks pretty scary.
The risk for the launch corridor went up to 47%, in the high category.
I was gonna suggest maybe Ben, since he compiled this, what would be his recommendation?
Looking at just wind and waves at this point, I feel like it's within a risk level that we would accept.
But based on the rain, the lightning, it's driving the numbers quite a bit higher.
Weather is very  fickle in Florida.
Some of the most intense lightning I've seen in the world happens at Cape Canaveral.
My job, at the end of the day, is to make sure that the risk is acceptable and give the final go-ahead for the mission.
I basically have to have nerves of steel.
It's terrifying when you say, "Yeah, go for launch."
It's gonna be right on the edge, probably.
We got to be crisp on this thing going forward.
Thunderstorms are such a big issue because our launch to the space station is an instantaneous launch window.
Basically, we have to wait for the Earth to rotate until station is directly overhead and then launch at that exact millisecond.
Any problems it's like, "Oh, we're scrubbed."
"We're not gonna go fly."
In addition to all those weather factors, one of the most nerve-racking moments is loading propellant with astronauts on board.
We're basically loading, like, a million pounds of, like, fuel and oxygen into this big tank, and the astronauts are sitting on top.
A rocket is an energetic system, and anything leaking can be pretty catastrophic.
We have had an incident in the past.
We destroyed the satellite, we destroyed the rocket, we destroyed the launchpad, and it took us months to figure out what happened.
The rocket blew up, but it was not caused by the fueling process, per se.
It was caused by a pressure tank.
I didn't expect it to fail that traumatic.
When you work on this, you really hope it works.
I'm cautiously optimistic about tomorrow.
There's nothing more we can think of to improve the probability of success.
But I don't wanna tempt fate.
There's always things you don't know about, so you don't know when those are gonna come and get you.
Making sure Bob and Doug are safe is not simply our first priority.
It is our only priority.
So at the top of the hour, we're gonna make another judgment on the weather.
But remember, thunderstorms down here in Florida are generally isolated, and so just because there's thunderstorms on the horizon doesn't mean we can't launch.
I'm more optimistic than pessimistic, but we're gonna get one last look at the top of the hour.
Thank you, sir.
-Have a great launch. -My pleasure. Thank you.
-Hey, this is huge. -We got more down there.
Gets me through the day.
It's not too bad.
I mean it's a mess, but at least it has a chance to clear up.
The big thing right now is isolated thunderstorms.
The question is, is it gonna be sufficiently problematic to where we can't launch?
Right now, I'm being told fifty-fifty.
Hi, it's me, Tim Dodd, the Everyday Astronaut.
I'm three miles away, looking at the rocket right now.
The weather is starting to clear up here a little bit, but I can tell you, based on the amount of people, this is definitely the launch to watch for the year, guys.
Now, just waiting to hear what's gonna happen.
My name is Jessie Anderson.
I'm a lead manufacturing engineer here at SpaceX, and I speak for all of us when I say we could not be more excited to finally be sending humans to the International Space Station.
It's a great day.
Today's mission is known as Demonstration Mission-2.
It's gonna be the first time a commercially built spacecraft will launch people to the space station.
Demo-2 is an end-to-end flight test, from launch all the way to docking, and ending with splashdown.
And it's the final test for NASA to certify SpaceX for regular crew flights to the space station.
I don't get nervous for launches.
I don't get nervous for doing speaking gigs.
Starting a month ago or so, I started getting nervous for this launch.
I shouldn't have eaten breakfast.
It's a stress-eating kind of day.
And then yesterday was tough, and today,just forget it.
Hard to get any work done at all today.
I always worry about the things that we don't know about.
Launch makes you superstitious.
It's called launch juju. Um, I don't know where that term came from.
I think it's an Air Force term actually, but people do very odd things.
So here's my Dragon socks.
Cool launch-day socks is my ritual.
I don't look at the mission sticker.
I can't look at it before we fly.
I will wear red sometimes when it's really important.
Don't wear red on launch day.
-Really? -Red means "no go." Don't wear it.
Wearing green would be extra good luck.
Hans has got it figured out.
I call it the launch beard. Like, you know, it grows out.
And then day of the launch, it cleans up.
I usually have a beard, but if we don't launch more than two days in a row, I shave the beard.
Why is that?
Just so that we can launch on the third day.
I was in Scotland for the first time we got to orbit, so for every launch, I put stickies in my shoe that say "Scotland" on it.
So I am always in Scotland when we launch.
Are you a very superstitious person?
I'm not at all, uh, except for this.
I think we've pounded flat the risks that we understand and the risks we know about, and I really hope we do the right thing by Doug and Bob and get them to the space station safely and inspire generations to come.
Really, we just can't fuck it up.
That's the most important thing about today.
No fucking it up.
This is my second one.
That was my first. So I don't know, is that like three? I don't know.
Okay, Jim, we have the, uh, official weather update.
The cell that they're worried about has moved to the north.
-So we're go for launch. -Fantastic.
-So we're gonna head over. -Yes.
Big day, sir.
I think anybody who's been involved in this for the last decade has got to be on the edge of their seat right now.
This agency has had many, many tough times in the past but for Bob and Doug's launch today, we've done everything we can.
There comes that moment when you say, "Okay, now is the time."
Here they come, NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.
They've each made this journey twice before.
There's Megan and Karen and their sons.
-I love you. -I love you, dad.
Here's my big hug. Here comes the big hug.
When you're saying goodbye to your family, you really realize that there's more to it than just a rocket going up.
To see your parent launch on the rocket, it's scary for a small kid.
The first time we shared it with him, his opinion was, you know, "Daddy can't go to space."
That's something I wasn't quite,prepared for.
I didn't expect to have that hit me as much as it did.
And we are following the convoy as they continue to make their way to the pad.
These people have been working long hours.
Coronavirus happened, and we made it.
And here they come.
Just minutes from now, the astronauts will climb into Dragon.
It's a beautiful view up there, too, of getting ready for the business at hand of heading to the cosmos.
We're gonna make sure all your zippers are closed, minus your gloves.
Good?
Does it feel like this line is gonna move?
And then this will kind of move off.This should subside anything behind it.
-Okay. -Probably a couple hours.
I think if we can get Elon here. I just wanna make sure he's in the loop.
I just wanna double-check. Who's doing the measurement?
Yeah, great, but who at the Range?
The Launch Weather Officer.
Basically,the whole weather office.
They're the ones that basically make the call on the Range weather.
Mike's gonna call it right now.
Dragon, SpaceX. Weather is go at this time.
Dragon copy. Go weather.
Dragon, SpaceX. You are go for section seven.
Close visors and arm launch escape system.
Visors coming closed.
7.2, our visors are closed, and we're arming the launch escape system.
Launch escape system is verified armed.
Launch director to countdown net, poll is complete, and we have a go to proceed with propellant load.
Propellant load has started.
Dragon, SpaceX launch director.
- 2 - D to violate a couple of weather rules that now do not expect to clear in time for launch.
- Proceed to 2 - D launch abort sequence, please.
We copy. We can see some raindrops on the windows, and it's just part of the deal.
Copy all.
That's it.
-It's aborted? -Yeah.
It's not our day.
Basically, we've got ten major weather rules, and three of them are in violation right now.
-Three? -Yeah.
At least eyeballing it, this does not look like we should be stopping launch.
We wanna make sure we're not scrubbing based on half-hour-old weather.
The measurement's real-time,it's real-time lightning.
We just wanna make sure it's real and we're not jumping at shadows.
Okay.
So next launch time is Saturday.
Okay.
I am bummed.
Yes, I am bummed too.
I, too, am bummed. Yes.
I am too.
Dragon, SpaceX. Thanks for the valiant effort today.
Appreciate your resilience.
Yeah, we appreciate those words.
Everybody did great today, and we'll do it again on Saturday.
Today, we're giving it another shot.
Wednesday's first attempt was postponed due to that wild weather, but if all goes well today, we will mark a new first and usher in the commercial-crew era of American spaceflight.
To get an actual scrub, it really was almost like a gift.
It was just one last chance to go through and evaluate and make sure everything's ready to fly.
But from an emotional standpoint, it was extremely difficult.
My son, Jack, was really hit pretty hard when we scrubbed.
Karen said he kind of went and sat in a chair and just wanted to be by himself.
He kind of gets that there's a lot that can go wrong.
He had already said goodbye to me, and I think he probably didn't wanna have to go through that again.
Hey, buddy, I love you.
This is gonna be cool.
Be good for Mommy.
See you, buddy.
Hey, Theo, you be on good behavior, okay?
And enjoy today. Watch the rocket for me, okay?
I'll call you from the space station.
Okay, you're welcome.
I love you.
To see your parent launch on a rocket is something that my son hasn't been exposed to.
I needed to figure out a way to prepare him for that.
This is tremor.
Tremor was actually my son's dinosaur.
I decided to bring Tremor and take him through the entire process, you know, to make it feel a little bit more normal for my son.
Core and countdown one in T-minus 2 hours and 46 minutes.
The crew has arrived at the White Room. Its ingress is in progress on schedule.
Launch Control, clear to retract the axis arm on time.
Crew access arm retract has started.
Launch director to countdown net, poll is complete, and we have a go to proceed with propellant load.
Copy.
What's up, Elon?
Looking a little nicer today.
It looks really nice.
-Oh, palo santo. -Yeah.
Like it. Anything you can do.
It's for good luck.
Situations like this, you can't have too much luck.
You believe in luck?
I believe luck is the best superpower.
If you can have any superpower, luck is the one you'd want.
Propellant fills are complete.
Falcon 9 is in startup. Dragon is in countdown.
FTS is armed for launch.
All right.
Holy shit, here we go.
Here we go.
Dragon, SpaceX. Go for launch.
SpaceX, Dragon. We're go for launch. Let's light this candle.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Ignition. Liftoff.
-It's going. -Here we go.
Stage one propulsion is nominal.

SpaceX, Dragon. Thanks for the great ride to space.
Congratulations. We just put astronauts in orbit.
-Incredible. -Yeah!
Yeah.
Well-done, guys.
-Good work. -That's awesome.
Congrats hug.
That's real, dude. That's space!
It only takes nine minutes to get to orbit.
Nine minutes, and you're going 25 times the speed of sound.
Bob and Doug are cool as cucumbers.
Just hanging out.
It looks too smooth.
Two dads.
Dads in space.
Well, everyone, kind of a tradition we've had with spacecraft, going way back to the Mercury era.
We're given the honor to name this capsule.
Without further ado, we would like to,welcome you aboard Capsule Endeavour.
I'll tell you that for the ride uphill, while it was an exciting ride, I think we got a couple of surprises just in terms of the way the vehicle is kind of moving and shaking and taking you into orbit.
You can tell that it's fighting against the Earth as it makes its way into space.
We did, it turns out, end up with one stowaway on board our vehicle when we launched today.
I hope both of our sons were super excited to see, uh, their toy floating around with us on board.
I'm sure they would rather be here, given the opportunity, but hopefully, they're proud of this as well.
So with that, I think it'll be good night from Capsule Endeavour.
Good night, Megan and Theo.
And Karen and Jack.
Thank you. Congratulations.
We can breathe another sigh of relief.
You're good there?
-He's left of the pole? Yeah? -I gotcha.
So far, everything has performed very, very well, and we are excited that Bob and Doug are safely in orbit and on the way to the International Space Station.
Elon, what would you say to those who doubted SpaceX could do this?
Do you have a message for them?
Do I have a message for those who
-What? -Who doubted you.
Doubted. Okay. I was like, "What did he?" Okay.
Maybe I just blank out the word "doubt."
No,to be totally frank, I doubted us too.
When starting SpaceX,I thought we maybe had a 10% chance of reaching orbit.
But fortunately, fate has smiled upon us and brought us to this day.
Elon, you said that you had told Bob and Doug's boys that you'd do everything you can to bring them home safely.
Even with a safe launch out of the way, that must still weigh on you, and I wondered what it's like as a dad.
We still gotta dock with Space Station. We still gotta return.
I think there's an argument that the return is more dangerous in some ways than the ascent.
So we don't wanna declare victory yet.
Anyway I'm getting choked up here, so I'm getting choked up. Sorry.
I'm not sure I can answer the question any more than that except, we're gonna do everything we can to make sure it gets home safely.
Good morning, everyone, from Endeavour.
We had a great night. Got to get a little sleep.
And as you can see, a beautiful day pass right now.
Getting pretty close to ISS, As we're flying at about 17,500 miles an hour around the planet.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check on big loop.
SpaceX, Dragon. Loud and clear now on the big loop.
Good morning, Anna.
Good morning. Great to hear your voice.
It's great to hear yours as well.
We're looking forward to rendezvousing with Space Station today.
I am responsible for being Bob and Doug's eyes and ears on the ground as they approach and then dock with the International Space Station.
My role is to help make sure that they are informed of anything that's going awry, and I am forever grateful to be a part of this moment.
One of my fourth-grade teachers was actually the daughter of one of the astronauts on the Challenger.
She brought our class to NASA, and from that time on, I knew I wanted to be a part of space operations.
I still am amazed by how she ultimately changed my life, and I imagine that she changed many other people's lives as a result of something that had to have been incredibly painful for her.
Dragon, SpaceX.
Your rendezvous complete time is expected to be 1050 UTC.
Copy.
As Dragon is approaching the space station, it's flying at incredible speeds.
It first does a series of burns to get it in close proximity to the space station until the point at which it is basically in a straight line towards the docking adapter.
The whole time, we are watching our telemetry and making sure that when it gets to the docking adapter, it is precisely where it needs to be.
One problem, and it's a collision.
We face that risk, and we deal with that by being extremely intentional in everything we do.
Space Station on the big loop.
Dragon, tally ho. I know you guys probably see it on the video cameras, but with the naked eye, we can see it as well.
Looking like a nice, shiny new friend.
Dragon copies. We'll be there in a second.

Crew on the International Space Station is ready for docking.
Dragon, SpaceX. You are go to execute final approach.
Copy. Go for docking.
We are following along with you.
One hundred meters away from the space station.
As we were approaching the space station, I remember being extremely focused.
I had a checklist in my mind.
We're inside 20 meters.
And I remember at one point, we were close to docking, and I looked up, and I saw Dragon.
I just had this moment of almost pinching myself that I couldn't believe this was happening.
I told myself this is an incredibly special moment.
Three meters to go.
Two meters.
We are inside the hands-off point. One meter to go.
Dragon, SpaceX. Docking sequence is complete.
Welcome to the International Space Station.
Dragon arriving.
The crew of Expedition 63 is honored to welcome Dragon and the commercial crew program aboard the International Space Station.
Bob and Doug, glad to have you as part of the crew.
Aboard the International Space Station, Commander Chris Cassidy standing by in node two.
He does have two crew members on board, both Russian cosmonauts.
He recently launched on the same Russian Soyuz spacecraft just a little more than a month ago.
And with that, Endeavour, welcome to the International Space Station.
Please come aboard.
Station, this is the NASA Administrator. Can you hear me?
We hear you loud and clear, sir.
Welcome to the space station.
Thank you, Chris. It's good to see you.
And welcome to Bob and Doug.
I will tell you, the whole world saw this mission, and we are so proud.
I have a question for Chris.
Our crew here decided to be about three days late.
You gotta work them overtime, I presume now, to get them caught up on all the activities that they missed out on.
The day they missed out on was a good one for them to skip.
It was Saturday housecleaning.
But I took care of it for them. We'll catch up next weekend.
But in all seriousness, we're looking forward to some operational stuff later in the month.
Maybe we'll get outside and do some space walks.
So we're all super excited to have two more crewmates to the Expedition 63 team.
Station, this is James Corden with the CBS Late Late Show.
How are you, gentlemen? Can you hear me?
James.
Welcome aboard the International Space Station.
We heard you loud and clear.
How are you getting on up there? How are you doing? Are you okay?
We're doing pretty good.
I think we're assimilating into the ISS life, trying to help Chris out as much as we can.
That's great. I'm jealous of both of you right now because I've spent most of my life wanting to be weightless.
Tell me, what's the best and worst thing about living life in zero gravity every day?
Look at this.
That's magnificent.
You can imagine that there's a lot of places, like going to the restroom, where you like stuff to stay where you put it.
And so we definitely find that frustrating at times.
Time to go.
You take the valve and that's where your business goes.
They have six crew quarters on board the space station, and those crew quarters are really, really nice.
You've got your laptop in there.
You've got your sleeping bag attached to a wall.
Can you reach down and touch your toes?
You probably would have to fold your computer up, and then you might be able to kind of do a sit-up, and not hit both walls.
I mean, it's certainly not huge, but it's actually kind of kind of cozy,if I had to be honest.
What kind of liquids can you drink?
Is there a cocktail hour in space?
Every hour is cocktail hour for astronauts.
Because you can drink balls of fluid right out of the air like that.
I don't know how many of these examples I wanna set for my son, because he'll be playing with his food all day if he gets the chance to see something like this.
Chicken.
We exercise for about two hours every day, with weight lifting and either running or cycling to maintain our health and our fitness for our return.
Our heart, its most important job is to feed the brain oxygenated blood.
And then when you take the gravity vector out of the picture, the heart sends too much up to the brain, and your head gets all puffed up.
The way your body adapts to weightlessness, I distinctly remember when I first got to space, every time I would flip upside down, I felt like I was upside down.
And there was a moment where I was trying to hang my sleeping bag on the mid-deck wall, and, just like this, my mind completely changed.
And from that point on, I could be in any orientation, and I never felt like I was upside down.
It was so neat to me, the way your body and mind just switch like that.
You feel congested because you still have all this extra volume in your head.
So your sense of smell and your sense of taste are dull.
We have every hot sauce known to humankind.
You pour that on absolutely everything.
I believe birthday wishes are in order, Bob. Is that true?
That's true. I got to join the 50-year-old club, just like these two other guys.
They've been teasing me all day about it.
Yeah, I know it's not safe to put 50 candles on a cake in a high-oxygen environment, but at least make everybody sing to you.
Because I know so well what Bob is doing, I know he's working really hard.
I've had those same experiences, and I know it's hard to be away from your family.
It was important to us to do something special.
That encouragement from home, I think, is really important, that we're thinking of him, that we know what he's doing is hard.
The work requires a lot of dedication, a lot of focus, a lot of problem-solving, and always a lot of risk.
Can you guys hear me?
Yeah, loud and clear. -Okay.
Check the PTT's off.
We're complete with the med-ox lab change-out procedure.
Going back to step 15 in 1.225.
Thanks, Doug, for working the setup so well.
Got us right on timeline. We appreciate it.
Chris and Bob, good morning.
- Good morning. -Good morning.
Okay, with that, we'll step into the post depress.
-EV1 copies. -EV2 copies.
To keep Space Station flying over the Earth, it's a constant maintenance program.
We do all these space walks to either add modules to the space station when we were building it.
And now it's to replace pieces of equipment that either are getting old or that fail.
Our mission is essentially to upgrade the batteries.
The power of the space station is maintained by the battery system.
Through the solar arrays, the batteries are recharged.
And so just like a rechargeable battery at home, after many years of these cycles, and then of course the hot and cold of being in space between daylight and darkness, those batteries wear out.
It's a big job, because these batteries are like 400 pounds apiece.
Fortunately, we got both Bob and Chris, two of our best spacewalkers.
-Doing good? -Yeah.
During my first two missions, I did six space walks associated with the construction of the space station.
But even though I've done it a couple of times, it doesn't get easy for me.
There's a lot of pressure in a situation like that, if you don't do your job,successfully, I could float off into space.
You have to compartmentalize and take deep breaths so that you can pace yourself and stay focused in the face of this daunting task.
Hey, Bob, we're ready with the crew lock depress.
We're gonna take the, uh, depress pump power switch to "on."
Okay. Depress pump power coming on.
Good luck, guys.
 Okay, guys, great job.
We're gonna pick up slowly.
Yeah.
Bob, for you, as you get outboard, you're looking for handrail 2075 for your green hook.
-It's kind of dark out here, Chris. -Yeah, it's kind of dark.
How much longer till daylight has me?
Approximately three and a half minutes till daylight.
Sun. - Here comes the sun again.
You should be coming up on the coast of California soon.
If you look south, you might see Hawthorne.
Bob, did you wanna go to battery one first?
Let's go to battery three first.
You'll be going to H1. Confirm socket tape line flush.
Looking for eight turns to release the battery.
I have control of the batteries?
You have control.
Okay, copy that.
Looks good, guys.
And we're about to enter a night pass.
Bob, I have several cautions and warnings for you when you're ready.
I'm ready.
Okay, no sudden movements.
The Bravo 7 torque setting may cause bolt failure.
This could result in a non-captive sharp edge and broken shank.
Copy all.
Is there any good news about this?
Sounds scary, Bob. You sure you wanna do that?
-Obviously. -Obviously.
It looks equal to me on both sides.
I agree.
In the indicator, those locked.
Copy, such a good install.
Just a heads-up, you're going into a day pass in about a minute.
 How about a picture?
It's a good location, good time.
Yeah.
I don't know if we're gonna make it through another day-night cycle.
Yeah, that's good.
To see the wondrous events that are happening as you go through a space walk, there's sunrises and sunsets, you realize,our world is precious, and you start having appreciation for how little you actually are.
And I think every astronaut kind of feels the same way.
As you go around the Earth, you don't see the lines and the borders that are drawn on maps.
You see the Earth as this one entity, and it's our home.
You sense its fragility in this sort of vast blackness of space and this very thin atmosphere that's what's keeping us all safe.
You feel very protective, I think, and you feel a very strong connection.
Even the most hardened, cynical astronauts, once they've gone to space, it's changed them and for the better.
You look down, and you go, "We're all on this little ball."
And then you look back into space and get this overwhelming sense of the things we're gonna do next.
Okay, Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
They've got the flag up now, and you can see the stars and stripes.
Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon.
They came in peace for all mankind.
Welcome home.
And so this is the leftovers, basically.
If you asked what inspired me, this is what inspired me.
-Saturn V? -Yeah.
I mean, that's what I saw when I was a kid.
This is pretty crazy.
You know how much thrust it had? A million and something?
Like the size of that gas generator, it almost looks like the size of our thrust chamber.
Yeah, it's huge.
This is the most powerful rocket that had been built up to date.
Yeah, you just need that energy to get to the Moon.
-Or to Mars. -Mars, so the other thing to recognize is this all like new stuff that they had made and didn't have much flight experience on.
I mean, we have 80-something flights.
And we're slowly getting into those flights.
Only now are we confident enough to put Bob and Doug in there.
And they tested it twice and said, "Okay, you guys go in there."
Yeah.
All right, let's go one step further.
-That's the lunar lander. -Yeah.
It looks small, actually.
-I wanna see that inside. -Yeah.
They'd be standing up in there, basically.
There's no chair or anything.
Yeah, and this had the rudiments of digital computers in there.
I mean, a computer on this thing, I don't think there's anything comparable that we have.
-A car key is probably smarter. -Yeah.
But, I mean, they made it work.
-I mean, that's the main thing. -That's the fascinating thing.
Even more dramatic when you think that what they had in terms of electronics to make that work.
Yeah.
Pretty inspiring coming back here and just looking at it.
Now that we've shown that we can fly astronauts it's time to go back to the Moon with astronauts again for a longer time and extend our range to Mars.
These super smart, super talented people,they believe in the goal.
A base on the Moon and a city on Mars can happen.
I was not sure whether such a path existed before.
Now I am confident that such a path exists.
But first, we got a real important mission tomorrow.
Good morning, Bob and Doug.
We have a special message for you to start your day.
Rise and shine, Daddy. We love you.
We can't wait to see you. Wake up, wake up!
I'm happy you went into space, but I'm even happier that you're coming back home.
Hurry home so we can go get my dog.
We love you, Dad.
We're about to embark on the final portion of the journey.
And as I look forward to heading back home, my son and Doug's son are really excited not only to get their fathers back but to get our Apatosaurus, our zero-G indicator, that they nominated to go with us.
And so for Jack and Theo, Tremor the Apatosaurus is headed home soon.
Reentry is obviously the next big milestone, and so everything has to work really well.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
SpaceX, Dragon. Comm checks. Dragon to ground.
It's hard to prepare yourself.
You don't know exactly what you're gonna feel.
But there's a part of you that can't let go of that sort of, you know, hopefully irrational fear that something could go wrong.
The final reconfigurations for undock are complete and nominal.
Am I gonna be nervous? Absolutely.
But I want my son to experience the joy and excitement of that moment and try to keep all of the… the nervousness to myself.
The ground is go for undocking.
Please confirm your visors are down and that you are ready for undock and departure.
Our visors are down, and we're ready for departure.
Dragon, SpaceX. Separation confirmed.
Endeavour, Station. Bob and Doug, it's been an honor to serve with you.
Safe travels and have a successful landing.
Godspeed.
Endeavour copies all. Thanks, Chris.
Bob and I, we're just excited to get back home.
But you can never let your guard down, especially on a first flight.
You really have to do the whole mission end to end.
There was a time when we thought, "Well, we just get through the ascent, and we'll be fine."
But then we had Columbia.
Everything look good to you?
Control and rates and everything is nominal, right?
Control has been stable. We have good trims.
-I don't see anything out of the ordinary. -Okay.
This is amazing. It's really getting fairly bright out there.
Yeah, you definitely don't want to be outside now.
Both Bob and I were on the runway where the shuttle would be landing.
I remember them knocking on the window and saying to us that they'd lost, and data and tracking from Columbia.
Columbia, Houston, comm check.
Columbia, Houston, UHF comm check.
We do not have any valid data at this time.
Oh my God.
We've got some breaking news.
There you see what appears to be multiple pieces of the shuttle.
We can only hope that what we're seeing is not the worst.
When landing time came and the shuttle didn't come, we were there in the room when they told the families what they think had happened and that it was likely not survivable and that they were, you know, gonna do the best they could, but when the vehicle broke up at 200, 250,000 feet, that it's not likely that anybody survived.
Just seeing the pieces of Columbia, pieces of the crew module and helmets and those kinds of things, that leaves an impression that I think you never ever you never really get over.
When you lose a rocket with a payload on it, that is a bad situation.
But if you lose a rocket with a crew on it, that is an order of magnitude different.
And in the end, you don't want anybody to ever have to go through that again.
We have been preparing for Bob and Doug to come home.
As soon as that capsule released, and we undocked, the nerves popped up again, the general feeling of like, "Oh man, we're in free flight."
And these boys are coming home. It's happening.
There's no turning back at this point.
So it's time to rock and roll, talk to the recovery dudes,and get Bob and Doug home.
Everything's been going very smoothly for Bob and Doug ever since they undocked from the space station yesterday.
Now just ready and waiting to begin the reentry process.
Yeah, really exciting day as we approach splashdown here in a matter of a few hours.
I've gotta talk to these two guys.
To think that this all started two months ago, and here we are.
-A few hours? -Yeah.
-How's everything looking? -Ready to go.
Yeah, everything's looking great. Dragon's in good shape.
All right, good luck.
-Good luck. -All right, good luck.
Oh, look at that.
They seem super calm.
I guess it doesn't go over well when they're nervous.
Actually, you can see they're nervous.
Every once in a while.
I think reentry is the part that everybody hates.
You're in a stable orbit around the Earth, and then you do a reentry burn.
That's a thrust maneuver that reduces your velocity so that you start descending until you hit dense atmosphere and you can't get a radio signal out anymore.
It's called "blackout."
For a few minutes, you're in the dark on the ground, and you have no idea what happens.
Okay, blackout here is 18:36, and you land at 48.
So that's 12 minutes before we land, is the blackout.
What altitude is that?
Does that sound too high?
It does sound a little bit high.
-Found it?
-Okay, fifty. -Fifty. Okay.
So it happens between 50 and 30 kilometers.
That means you fall from 30 kilometers to six kilometers in two minutes?
-That's crazy. -That seems crazy fast, man.
-Yeah. -Remarkable.
You're moving at high speed, and you're using the atmosphere to brake.
It's a lot of energy.
It gets hot on the outside, and on the inside, you see the fire flying by the window.
You need a heat shield that is perfect.
And after you get through the atmosphere, you still have to deploy the parachutes.
They come out, then two minutes later, you deploy the chutes. It's pretty quick.
In my mind, it's probably the parachutes that are the most significant thing that needs to work.
In spite of all the testing we've done, that's still one of the riskiest parts.
Right.
We haven't had a splashdown since the Apollo program.
Yeah.
Dragon, SpaceX for entry brief.
Go ahead.
The recovery team is go, and the weather is great, and your vehicle is still looking really good for entry.
No health issues at this time.
How long until they hit the atmosphere?
They go into the sequence in five minutes.
I'm actually here for the deorbit burn.
To make sure that goes well.
-Deorbit burn's coming up now? -Yeah.
Everything's looking good, I think.
Yeah,it certainly has been quite a journey.
Crazy. Here we are, right?
Yes, 18 years.
-Are you nervous? -Yeah, I am.
Dragon, SpaceX. Deorbit burn start.
Cool as a cucumber, because they're not breathing very heavy, because their CO2's not going up.
-That's good. -Yeah.
Dragon, SpaceX. Deorbit burn complete.
Performance nominal.
Nose cone closure initiated.
Brace for entry.
Copy.
All right.
Here we go.
Four G's. That's moving.
Almost like a little comet.
Dragon, SpaceX. We show two minutes until predicted comm blackout.
We will see you on the other side at 18:42.
Dragon copy, 18:42.
Okay, we're in blackout.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Jesus, dude. This thing is so long.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Come on, where is it?
Let's find that puppy.
There it is.
Dragon, SpaceX. Comm check.
Copy, I heard you loud and clear. We're about 3.9 G's.
Copy, we've got you.
-All right. -Hell yeah.
Coming in hot.
Passing 15 kilometers, brace for drogue window.
Copy, we're braced.
Come on, baby.
Visual, two drogues out.
Oh yeah, we felt it.
Slow down, baby.
 Drogue descent rate nominal.
Nice.
Yep.
All right.
Let's get these mains out.
Inflate, baby.
Inflate.
Come on.
Come on.
We are visual on four chutes out.
Hold on. Almost down to the ground.
Main chute decent rate nominal.
Passing through 700 meters.
And we're back to seven meters per second.
It's like sitting there.
 Six hundred meters.
Six hundred meters.
Two hundred meters.
We are braced for splashdown.
Copy. Brace for splashdown.
Welcome back to planet Earth, and thanks for flying SpaceX.
All right.
Everything's good?
Everything was great. This was super smooth.
Okay.
Are there small boats out there?
That doesn't look like a 45-footer to me.
Who the hell is this?
-It's a boat there. Not ours. -It's someone else?
Not ours. Yeah, these are not our boats.
-Who is that? Just random people? -Just random people.
Look at this, dude, just like fucking 30 jabroni boats just show up out of nowhere.
You got a front-row seat.
Dragon, SpaceX. Stand by for side hatch opening and egress.
Copy. We're ready.
All right, so they're getting set up.
They're gonna work to get Bob Behnken, the joint operations commander for this mission, out of the capsule now.
We got a thumbs-up, indicating that things are going well.
And now spacecraft commander Doug Hurley making his way out of the capsule.
There we go. Another thumbs-up.
-Don. -Thank you.
Will you have some?
Here's to happiness and to Bob and Doug safely home.
No doubt.
It had been a couple of months since we had launched, so I was just really excited to see my family.
But first, we were going to do a little bit of a press event.
Six-year-olds, they didn't have him in handcuffs or anything, so he broke free and ran to me at the airplane.
It was just awesome to see him.
I'm glad I didn't fall down the steps when he tried to tackle me at the base of the stairs.
All right,we're not gonna stand right now.
For those of you who have done this before, you know it's not pleasant standing for a few hours after you get back.
Five hours ago, we were in a spaceship bobbing around, making prank satellite phone calls to whoever we could get ahold of.
This has been a quite an odyssey the last five years since Bob and I started working on this program.
And to be where we are now, the first crewed flight of Dragon, is just unbelievable.
There's something special about having that capability to launch and bring your own astronauts home.
I just wanna thank you all for coming out today and celebrating what was accomplished.
After these great words that were spoken, I'm not sure I have much to add.
I mean, I really came here because I just wanted to see Bob and Doug, to be totally frank.
My entire adrenaline, it was just dumped.
You know?
I think this is an achievement of humanity, and I think the whole world can look at this as a new era.
We're gonna have a base on the Moon, and we're gonna have send people to Mars.
Have and make life multi-planetary.
And I think this day heralds a new age of space exploration.
You're looking at the Crew Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket set to launch four astronauts to the International Space Station on a six-month science mission.
This crew is about to fly in the exact same capsule that first flew NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley in last year's Demo-2 test flight.
This is the second crew to fly on a commercial spacecraft for this new era of human spaceflight.
And here they come, the Crew-2 astronauts taking their first steps outside before their journey to space.
 Pilot Megan McArthur in the front.
Hey, Mommy, I love you.
Looks like Bob Behnken is there with their son.
They are a power couple, and I love it.
Now it's time for Megan's mission.
It's super exciting for us that she's gonna be able to ride the same Dragon capsule.
And so I need to step in in the backup role and flip-flop and make sure our son Theo gets everything he needs.
See you in six months.
See you in six months. I'm gonna miss you.
My husband flew the Crew Dragon last year and happened to be in the same seat that I'll be in.
This time it's Mom's turn, and I'm gonna be up there for six months.
As our son gets older, he's starting to build an awareness of what it is that we do.
We want him to understand we think it's important to explore and to push the boundaries of what we're capable of.
The crew now on their way to Launch Complex 39 - A, ready for their ride to the space station.
I embrace this dawn of this age of commercialization of space.
Our mission proved that we could get humans in the low Earth orbit and kind of planted the seed for how we're gonna go beyond that.
As we go forward, we wanna accomplish all those missions that help us understand what's out there, but at the same time, we have to figure out the smart way to take care of the resources and our solar system and not trash Mars when the opportunity presents itself.
Of course, there will be questions and challenges, like how we're gonna govern something like that.
But if we can continue to get people into space, I can't imagine it doesn't make us better.
Elon, are you go?
Absolutely.
MJ, we're here. We just spoke to Elon. He's ready to go.
We should think more about, what's the future we want?
What has the happy ending?
For me, it's making sure we become a spacefaring civilization.
Dragon, SpaceX. You are go for launch.
But it's very important to appreciate this is not inevitable.
People are mistaken when they think that technology just automatically improves.
It does not automatically improve.
If you look at great civilizations like ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that.
And the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts.
They forgot how to do it.
In 1969, we were able to send somebody to the Moon, and we forgot how to do that.
T-minus 15 seconds.
The window of opportunity is open right now to make life multi-planetary.
But we cannot count on it being open for a long time.
Ten, nine, eight, seven.
We need to take advantage of that window while it is open.
four, three, two, one.
Endeavour launches once again.
Four astronauts from three countries on Crew-2 now making their way to the one and only International Space Station.
Crew Dragon flying free.
It takes 120 trillion cells to make a human.
They are the fundamental units of life, making up our brain, muscles, organs - every part of us.
In the last decade, scientists have been able to witness what once seemed impossible.
When I was a student, the idea that we could burrow deep inside a living cell was unthinkable.
Recent advances have made it so scientists can see inside cells.
We can see the parts of single cells and how they work together.
The more we learn about the universe, the simpler it seems.
But the cell isn't like that.
The more we find out, the more complicated things get.
But these beautiful worlds are also on the front line of the longest war.
This is a battle that goes back into the depths of time, to a time when the earth was dominated by single cells and viruses.
Every day, our cells confront these ancient virus enemies, tiny, ruthless machines that kill to reproduce.
There is this whole mechanism inside cells that are taking out viruses that previously we just didn't know was there.
It is a four-billion-year-old struggle that has changed the course.
This battle of these viruses against your cells, this amazing, epic science fiction movie, it's going on inside your body all the time, and you don't even know it.
Cells are the basic building blocks of living tissue, and the smallest units of what makes us human.
And yet... beneath the surface of every one lies a world stranger.
A world in which a billion microscopic machines all play their part, working in concert through every second.
Every one of us in made of 120 trillion cells, and every one of those cells is different.
But they contain the same instructions.
Cells are a bit like babies. When they're born, they all look the same but they change very quickly.
In different countries they learn to speak different languages, and our bodies are like that - some cells speak heart, and some cells speak liver.
The workers of this incredible world are proteins, chains of complex chemicals.
Others work to create incredible structures, like the internal skeleton that holds the cell together.
These great trusses are constantly adjusting to stresses and strains, building and rebuilding to give the cell it's shape and strength.
Then there are the motor-proteins, haulage workers that use the cell's skeleton as highways to deliver food, chemicals and the essential building materials of life to wherever they are needed.
They are just one of the astonishing micro machines that keep this bustling community healthy.
Scientists are asked all the time, how do things in a cell know how to get where they're supposed to go to do their job?
And for sure cells are very chaotic and things are bumping.
But enough things get where they're supposed to go.
And powering all this activity are the cell's power stations.
Inside these free-floating structures called mitochondria, turbines spin at over 1,000 times per minute recharging billions of tiny chemical batteries.
Everything we do, every heartbeat, every movement, every thought, is powered by the batteries charged by these cellular power stations.
And everything in this world works to a master plan.
And the plan is protected deep in the heart of every cell.
The nucleus is the vault containing the instruction manual for life.
DNA.
DNA is a chain of chemicals, organised into genes.
Each gene holds the instructions to build a specific protein.
The double helix contains over 20,000 instructions how to organise not just our cells, but our entire bodies.
The double helix has become the icon of the 21st century, and it's pretty amazing stuff.
There's six feet of DNA in every cell of the body.
And if all of those bits were set out in a straight line, they'd reach to the moon and back thousands of times.
But this crucial chain of chemicals would be useless without an army of microscopic machines that endlessly travel it's length, repairing it and transcribing it, turning the DNA into instructions that the cell can understand.
Once a gene has been copied, the instructions are carried outside the nucleus.
Here, mobile factories read them and turn them into proteins.
Up to two million different kinds, each with it's own specific shape and purpose.
And little goes to waste in the cell.
Used and faulty proteins are tagged for recycling... then chewed apart by powerful roving shredders called proteasomes, reducing them to tiny building blocks for new proteins.
But each cell is also part of a wider neighbourhood of cells, all continually communicating with each other.
Fragments of shredded proteins are constantly transported to the surface.
Here, they are presented for inspection.
These roving soldiers check the protein fragments for signs.
And for the moment, everything is in order.
Every single human cell contains this world of breathtaking complexity, organised by the nuclear machines at it's heart, ceaselessly working from instructions written down in our DNA.
But our cells are under constant attack, and this cell is about to face an ancient enemy in an encounter that starts with an event so commonplace... you seldom even notice it.
Every day our bodies are constantly bombarded by these invisible critters.
it's our first line of defence that keeps them out.
But we have Achilles heels - we have openings to the outside world, our mouths, our noses, we touch things, we rub our lips, we rub our eyes or wipe our nose. They can get in.
And once they're in, they're in.
Inhaled from a sneeze, an alien army is being carried into our body.
A million invaders, hellbent on destruction.
This is one of our most common enemies - the adenovirus.
It's a masterpiece of design, and each one has a single aim... to breach a cell's defences and reach the nucleus.
Once inside, any one of these viruses can take control of the cell... and reproduce 10,000 times over.
The result could be anything, from the common cold to pneumonia even death.
But our bodies are prepared.
As the viruses approach the cell, they are met by a cloud of resistance.
Antibodies, Y-shaped proteins that identify alien intruders patrol the space between our cells, looking for viruses.
Recognising the invader, they lock to the virus's armour plating, shackling them together, making the viruses easy meat for the white blood cells that feed on alien invaders like these.
Antibodies and white blood cells form the front line.
The immune system is certainly amazing, and it actually evolved to see invading microbes and get rid of them. But that's just one part of your body's defences.
Our DNA encodes all these other features that help us to fight against virus at every single step.
Despite the body's early immune response... hundreds of thousands of viruses make it through to our cell.
But at the surface, they face their next obstacle the cell's membrane, or skin.
The surface of the cell is an amazingly complicated place.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of receptor proteins sticking out of the cell and they all have a unique function to play.
Some of them will be just transporting information from outside of the cell into the cell.
Other receptors can bring whole cargoes in.
Teeming with security proteins that constantly monitor molecules as they enter and leave.
Small molecules like water and oxygen can simply seep through the membrane.
Larger molecules, like sugar.
But the largest deliveries require a special key before they are allowed into the cell.
These protein keys are recognised by teams of mobile sentries that continually roam the surface.
This sophisticated system is designed to keep harmful molecules out of the cell.
But over billions of years of evolution, the adenovirus has evolved it's very own key, etched into the end of these projecting fibres.
Antibodies still cling to the some of these fibres, blocking many of the counterfeit keys - but not all.
One by one, sentries all over the cell's surface are fooled.
And the virus army quietly slips inside.
In this ancient battle for the cell, it's round two to the virus.
So, how far back does it go, this cat and mouse game, this battle between cells and viruses?
Every indication suggests it goes right back to the origins of life on Earth.
Wherever life started, very early on there was a divergence, two different strategies that life followed.
One of them was to become more complex, to become cells, to become, ultimately, organisms like ourselves.
The other way was to remain simple - to become viruses, and to exploit those cells to their own ends, to replicate themselves.
Beneath the surface, the cell prepares to receive the deadly invaders.
Fooled into thinking that the virus is an important nutrient, special proteins slot together to form a spherical mould.
They pinch out a bubble of cellular membrane, wrapping the virus inside.
Finally, a separate protein pinches the bubble free, delivering the virus into the cell's interior.
Unwittingly, the cell has just taken a large step towards to it's own downfall.
Every single member of this invading virus army has the weaponry to ultimately destroy this cell.
It's protein shell is a multi-layered cloak of deception, which has still more surprises in store.
And at it's heart, it carries a tiny string of DNA, it's ultimate weapon.
It's a masterpiece of evolution and design.
And yet scientists still can't decide if it's actually alive or dead.
At the level of large animals like ourselves, the difference between living things and non-living things is very obvious.
Come down a level, though, to cells, and it becomes a bit more ambiguous.
For our own cells, of course, you can still tell immediately that they are alive. Come down another level, though, to the virus, and it's no longer obviously alive. They don't look alive.
Yet they behave perhaps as if they are.
They behave with a sense of purpose.
A virus isn't strictly alive, it can't make more of itself on it's own.
It only can replicate if it uses parts that it hijacks from a cell.
But the cell still has a formidable array of defences to keep these killing machines at bay.
Every delivery that the cell receives is taken to a sorting station, called an endosome.
Endosomes process incoming supplies and decide where inside the cell they will be delivered.
The first step of the process is to break them down.
The virus army is about to be digested.
The walls of the sorting stations are fitted with specialised protein pumps.
The pumps draw in special atoms, turning the inside of the endosome into an acid bath.
The acid breaks down large nutrients into smaller molecules that are easier for the cell to transport and use.
And as the acid eats away at the virus's outer shell, it begins to break apart.
This should spell disaster for the adenovirus.
But the acid is part of it's escape plan.
The virus fibres are the first to break away.
But their disintegration releases a special protein hidden inside the virus... that targets the wall of the sorting station... tearing the membrane apart and setting the virus free.
But not every virus escapes.
Many still carry antibodies locked to their surface.
Their primary job was to alert the immune system to intruders, but their firm grip now ties the shell together.
The fibres cannot break free, and the escape protein stays trapped inside the shell.
Countless viruses are eaten away before they can escape.
But enough are released.
Now there is nothing between these viruses and the nucleus of the cell - their ultimate goal.
Yet although they are just five micrometres from their target... most might as well be a million miles away.
For 90% of the army, the invasion will end here, floating helplessly beneath the surface.
Although they are surrounded by the constant bustle of cellular activity, the inert invaders have no way of moving themselves.
And they have no way of utilising the energy generated by the cells' floating power stations the mitochondria.
Inside each mitochondrion, the food we eat and the air we breathe drives thousands of turbines that continually recharge billions of tiny batteries.
But what is even more extraordinary is that scientists believe that mitochondria were once simple cells themselves.
Then they one was swallowed by another cell, firing one of the greatest leaps in evolution complex life.
To be complex at all, you must have all this machinery, all these proteins encoded by genes.
And to support all of that requires a tremendous amount of energy.
All complex life share a single common ancestor, and that ancestor arose just once in four billion years of life on Earth.
For two to three billion years it was bacteria and nothing else, and then this complex cell arose.
One simple cell got inside another simple cell, it's a very rare event in itself.
And once this happened, it transforms the energetic possibilities of life.
Without that energy, evolution could never have produced the astonishing diversity of life that we see around us.
Without that energy, we wouldn't see plants and animals, we wouldn't see ourselves. The world would be an almost sterile desert.
Throughout each cell, hundreds of mitochondria feed energy to power the network of protein that make us the complex creatures that we are.
The virus has evolved into a model of efficiency.
But the simplicity of it's design makes it useless without the machinery of complex life.
But just beneath the surface, large numbers of motor proteins, molecular haulage workers, await nutrients processed for delivery by the endosomes.
And in this billion-year arms race the virus has evolved the precise mechanism to attach to the cell's motor proteins.
Now it can use the energy of the mitochondria.
The virus is on it's way.
It has hijacked the cell's own transport system, and is being carried towards the nucleus and it's ultimate prize, the DNA machines it needs to take control of the cell.
These microscopic motorised legs are a wonder of the natural world.
Slowed down to one-thirtieth of their normal speed, their movement is clearly visible.
But at their actual speed, over 100 steps a second, they would appear a blur.
But speed isn't everything.
Cells are densely packed, and their internal highways are littered with obstacles.
And these motor proteins can only move in one direction.
For this virus, it seems to be the end of the road.
But scientists have recently discovered the virus locks on to a second motor protein.
And this one is built to move in the opposite direction.
Together, the two motor proteins can navigate around almost any obstacles.
And once again, the invader benefits.
The virus is on the move again.
And it leads an army of hundreds.
It's been almost an hour since the adenovirus first attacked the cell.
The nucleus is just one more hour away.
Until recently, scientists thought that once the viral army was on the march, nothing could stop it.
But then they found that the cell has it's own internal immune system.
There is this whole mechanism inside cells that are taking out viruses that previously we just didn't know was there.
And I remember the day we published the paper about it, I woke up to hear it being announced on the national radio and then went into a shop to pick up the newspapers to discover it was on the front page.
Dotted along the cell's highway system, a special protein searches for anything carrying antibodies from the surface.
The clever thing about this protein is it uses systems that the cell already has in place.
Once it's stuck to the antibody, it sends signals to a cellular machine called the proteasome.
And the proteasome plays the role of recycling proteins in the cell.
It gets brought along to the virus and it destroys the virus, breaking down all it's parts into tiny fragments.
Once attached, the defence protein initiates a chain reaction, attracting specialised tagging proteins.
Together, they mark the virus for destruction.
Then it's only a matter of time.
They rip the virus to shreds.
Somewhere inside your body, this battle is raging right now.
The discovery of TRIM21 provides potentially new ways of making therapeutics to fight viruses, and one way this could work is if we find ways of encouraging the immune system to make more TRIM21.
So as soon as that virus enters into the cell, the TRIM21 is ready to recognise the antibodies and destroy the virus.
By working together, the defence proteins and recycling shredders can destroy an army of viruses in just a few hours.
But it only takes a single virus to take control of an entire cell... spreading infection throughout the body.
With no antibodies attached, this virus has evaded the cell's shredders.
Nothing now stands between it and it's target.
The virus is now just one thousandth of a millimetre from the nucleus.
But if it is to achieve it's ultimate goal, it first has to get inside.
Compared to the cell, the virus is tiny.
But really they're just different versions of the same machine, and it's only job is to copy itself.
But the virus needs to take advantage of our cell mechanism for it's own selfish ends.
At the heart of every cell lies the nucleus, and it is a world all of it's own.
It's surface is made of the same molecules as the cell membrane.
But entry into this world is governed by completely different gateways.
Across the surface, protein arms search for molecules to draw inside nuclear pores.
Through these gateways, billions of chemical messages and instructions pass between the DNA and the cell.
But only if they are recognised by the protein arms.
But once again, the viral shell carries a counterfeit pass.
The arms lock on, but the virus is too large to be ferried inside.
Thinking that they have hit an obstruction the motor proteins shunt the virus into reverse.
Pulled in two directions... the virus is ripped apart.
But what looks like a catastrophe for the virus is, in fact, it's masterstroke.
Now the single strand of DNA it held inside is carried through the pore, and into the cell's control centre.
Inside the human cell nucleus there are about 23,000 genes.
They code for thousands and thousands of biochemical pathways.
The virus has just got 40, but with those 40 it can do remarkable things.
It's so tiny, just a piece of DNA, a couple of proteins to make it's shell, and yet it can take over and wreak havoc in a huge human cell.
It's brilliant.
The adenovirus has proven itself a master of deception continually exploiting the cell's processes to further it's own deadly aims.
But it's greatest trick is yet to come.
The cell's DNA machines have no way of telling the difference between it's own DNA and the DNA of the virus.
Blindly, they set about converting it's deadly code into thousands of instructions for the cell to act upon... blueprints for the cell's own destruction.
But the machines that turn the blueprints into proteins lie outside the nucleus.
Out in the main body of the cell, the instructions are met by a squadron of mobile protein factories, called ribosomes.
The ribosomes precisely follow the instruction and start to construct viral proteins.
Each is carefully folded into a specific shape, with a unique job to do.
These large cellular machines, ribosomes, are absolutely fundamental to life, and very similar forms of them are found in every type of living cell on the planet.
They read the genetic information and they decode it, bringing in the building blocks that make up proteins and sticking them together to make these functional molecules that are going to work inside the living cell.
Only these functional molecules are the kit of parts needed to build an enemy army.
But the army will not be built out here.
The raw material for the new army is drawn back inside the nucleus... ready for construction.
With it's mission reaching it's climax, the virus turns it's attention to the cell's DNA, halting any process it doesn't need.
The virus has taken complete control.
And yet the cell still has a small window of opportunity.
Before all normal activity stops, it has just enough time to send a message to the outside world.
This parcel contains fragments of the viral army.
The parcel merges with the cell membrane, and the enemy fragments are pushed to the surface, flags warning of the invasion that has taken place.
If patrolling white blood cells spot the distress signal... they will destroy the cell, along with the entire alien army inside.
If not, the infection will spread from cell to cell, to cell.
After just one day of occupation, the virus has complete control over the cell.
With routine maintenance halted, the cell has started to decay.
And all activity is now focused on building the brand new viral army inside the nucleus.
The new army self-assembles.
How do viruses know how to invade our cells, how to break and enter the nucleus itself?
We know that viruses and cells co-evolved together over long periods of time, but it's more than that.
We're actually surprisingly closely related.
It turns out that the viruses that attack us are actually made from bits and pieces of our own cells.
As our cells were evolving, as our nucleus itself was first coming to be, so these viruses were cobbled together from bits and pieces, and they can attack our nucleus because they're made of the same stuff.
Already built into it's surface are the binding sites for the cell's motorised legs.
Fibres snap into place, arming each virus with the keys to enter other cells.
But these shells are harmless without it's instructions.
The final component is loaded - identical copies of the virus's deadly DNA.
Carried by powerful motors, long strands of DNA are fed into every single virus.
All this is the result of one single virus getting through our cell's defences.
It's been two days since the virus entered the body, and the nucleus, once the centre of cellular organisation, now harbours an army of 10,000 deadly viruses.
But before it can begin it's conquest, it has to overcome two barriers.
The army is trapped inside the tough nuclear membrane, held at the centre of the cell itself.
And then there is the skin of the cell itself.
The protein factories outside the nucleus are instructed to build viral saboteurs.
The first are released into the decaying cell and target it's cytoskeleton.
The effects are cataclysmic.
Without support... the cell starts to collapse.
Now the virus turns it's attention to the nuclear membrane.
A second protein is released.
Called the Adenovirus Death Protein, it burrows into the membrane and weakens it.
The nucleus can no longer contain the bulging army.
Beyond the nucleus, the cell is a wasteland... unrecognisable from the harmonious, buzzing community of just 48 hours ago.
The cell is now completely helpless to stop the virus army from flooding into surrounding tissue... attacking neighbouring cells and spreading infection throughout the body.
The battle for this cell is over.
But the war has only just begun.
While the virus has been busy inside the cell, our antibodies have adapted and now come back in force, carrying new receptors, tailor-made to lock onto the escaping army.
Yet even in these numbers, they cannot stop every virus.
But they are not alone.
The cell's dying message to the outside world was not in vain.
Giant white blood cells flock to the stricken cell to devour the escaping hordes.
They too are learning how to tackle this particular invader.
Once the virus has been detected by the immune system, there's a heightened level of security inside your body, and one of the results of this is that the cells that make antibodies, and make the right antibody for that virus, will make lots of copies of themselves.
And then they will start pumping out up to 5,000 antibodies per second to flood your bloodstream, the spaces between your cells, so as the viruses emerge from dying cells, they can get tagged by antibodies, then destroyed by white blood cells.
Taking no chances, white blood cells engulf nearby cells that may have been infected.
Meanwhile, surrounding healthy cells make the ultimate sacrifice, destroying themselves to stop the spread of the virus.
It is only at this stage that we become aware of the battle taking place inside us.
Increasing blood flow brings more white blood cells to the battleground, causing our nasal tissue to become inflamed.
What we feel is a blocked nose is, in fact, the clearest sign of a viral onslaught.
Once you've had an infection, one cell, that makes the antibody for that infection, will be kept inside your bone marrow for the rest of your life.
So that if you ever get another infection with the same virus, the immune system already knows how to respond, it knows what antibody to make and it can respond very quickly and stop you getting sick.
Working together, the body's immune system finally prevents the viral infection from spreading.
It's one more battle in an unending war.
The struggle between viruses and ourselves is evolution, but it's co-evolution - both sides have to change.
It's a bit like an arms race - one party gets better weapons, the other party has to match them.
Even though the individual cells are fighting this epic battle against viruses, remember, you have trillions of cells.
And so even if one cell loses it's war, most of the time the organism wins and we get better.
The war is over.
For now.
Although many cells have been lost, there are many more healthy cells waiting to replace them.
And at the heart of each one lies an identical copy of our DNA.
Inherited from our parents, and their parents over countless generations, our DNA connects us to a family tree that stretches back over three billion years, to the very first cell... a cell that existed long before humans, long before mammals, long before the dinosaurs.
It's a lineage that connects us to every living creature and plant on Earth.
We are all descended from a single prehistoric ancestor, a cell containing the single strand of DNA that started it all.
But the virus is as old as we are.
It has evolved alongside us, forcing us to adapt, to change or die in a deadly game of cat and mouse.
This eternal arms race has driven our evolution and made us both stronger.
We wouldn't be what we are today were it not for this battle with our ancient enemy.
The story of the cell is a story of innovation and change, and because viruses continuously force cells to change, they actually aid their adaptation to different environments.
And for that reason they've also helped shape us, they've made us who we are.
Every minute of every day, this battle with the virus rages within seven billion of us.
Though we are rarely aware of it, we fight each other, change each other, improve each other.
