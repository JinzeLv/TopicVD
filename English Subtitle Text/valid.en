 This picture,  truly one of the most unusual ever filmed,  contains scenes which under no circumstances  should be viewed by anyone with a heart condition  or anyone who is easily upset.
 We urgently recommend  that if you are such a person or the parent  of a young or impressionable child now in attendance,  that you and the child leave the auditorium.
 Narrator: Rome was the largest and the most beautiful city  of the ancient world.
 The magnificent facade of the empire, however,  could not conceal the seeds of decay,  the unhealthy dependence of the economy on slaves,  the disparity between rich and poor.
 Behind the splendor of the Forum  were vast areas of crowded slums.
 Escape from the slums was difficult for there were few jobs available  and practically none for the unskilled.
 To keep idle citizens entertained and out of mischief,  frequent games and spectacles were held at public expense.
 At first, only chariot races were sponsored.
 But by the reign of Trajan,  brutal combat to the death had become popular.
 Earlier in Rome's history,  elected representatives exercised the power.
 But by now, every function of government  had been absorbed by the emperor  who was above the law and ruled by decree.
 That a people as civilized as the Romans,  with the most humane system of law ever devised,  could tolerate the violation of human beings  is astonishing.
 This imbalance and the irresponsible behavior  of public officials would become major reasons  for Rome's eventual decline.
 Michael Moore: I wonder how future civilizations will view our society.
 Will they judge us by this?
"He's a cat flushin' a toilet, he's a cat flushin' a toilet "
 "He's a cat flushin' a toilet."
 Man #1: Do you see the sheriff's car?
 Man #2: Yeah, right there. The sheriff-- that's the first car.
 - Woman: No-- - There he is.
 - Man #1: Give me the phone. - Woman: It's on this--  it's on the c-- it's on the couch.
 All right, that's as close as I can get, Dad.
Don't stand in front of the door, Dad.
 (whispering) Get out from the--  Hey, Sheriff, Robert inside the house here.
 Woman: They're trying to beat the back door in, Dad.
 There are 4 of us in here. They're beating on the door.
 We're not gonna resist, but you will have to come  in the house on your own.
 But there are 4 souls in this house.
 Woman: Dad, don't stand in front of the door.
 - Do not. - (doorknob rattling)  Woman: Another witness.
 Tell your name to the camera.
 - I'm David Phillips. - Chris Collins.
 And Audra Collins.
 - David: And this is America? - Chris: Uh-huh.
 Audra: This is America, folks, what you're watching right here.
 - Sheriff's office. - Robert: Yeah, we know.
 - Okay, y'all have to come out, please. - Robert: All right.
 Woman: We cannot act like this-- this is just something that's okay.
 And so this is new.
 They've never come out and boarded up our house  after they've evicted the person  and threw their furniture in the dumpster.
 So they're letting us know  that they are stepping it up,  boarding up somebody's house.
 This has been my family home. This is my parents' house.
 I've lived here for 41 years.
 This is the only home I've ever really lived in.
 This is the only-- this will always be home to me, no matter what.
 - I'm a carpenter. - Woman: There you go.
 Man #1: Sandra, they're leaving. Let them leave.
 - Man #2: I'm a carpenter. So what? - That's all I am.
If people pay their bills,they don't get put out.
 - Well, people pay their bills. - This could happen to you.
 Carpenter: That's right. So why do you think I'm doing it?
 I don't have to be happy about this, but that's what I do.
 Sandra: That's all I'm saying is that maybe you can make another choice.
 - That's all we're saying. - That's no reason for...  Sandra: You're a working-class person.
 ...people here to get upset and almost get themselves hurt.
 We ain't gonna get hurt.
 Are you threatening us?
 Y'all gonna get on out of here. You might end up even getting hurt.
 Talking about us getting hurt, you might get hurt.
 Man: There's gonna be some kind of a rebellion  between the people that have nothing  and the people that's got it all.
 I don't understand.
 There's no in-between no more.
 There's the people that's got it all  and the people that have nothing.
 We gotta get this stuff out of the house and packed up  and be out of here in about 30 days  even though we don't have a place to go.
 Oh.
 Woman: We designed this house.
 The property that it's on was my family farm.
 So I've lost a piece of my heritage with this.
 Why do you do this to the hard-working people?
 Why do you take everything?
 You take everything away from them.
 We're just middle-class, hard-working people  trying to make a living.
 Just trying to survive.
 (grunts) My pistol,  my dad's pistol, my pistol.
 - (knocking) - Man: Sheriff's department.
 It's supposed to be 30 days.
 I got 30 days to get my stuff out.
 - That's what the guy told me. - No.
 What?
 It's currently scheduled for today.
 But...  The paper's telling us that we are due  to do an eviction here today at 9:00 AM.
 Huh, shoot.
 Well, he's surprised too.
 The house is gone.
 That cop told me that the house  has already been sold to somebody else.
 So we don't own the house no more, somebody else does.
 Moore: This is capitalism,  a system of taking and giving--  mostly taking.
 The only thing we didn't know  was when the revolt would begin.
 Man: Everything, we've tried everything...  except robbing a bank.
 I'm thinking about maybe doing that.
 You know, that's one way somebody could get their money back.
 If they did it-- they did it to me,  I don't know why I can't do it to them.
 Peter Zalewski: This is my second Hyundai Sonata.
 I'll probably get a new car next year.
 And when I do, it'll probably be another Sonata.
 You know, I'm not a car guy.
 If I can go in there and steal a condo  for the equivalent of what a Mercedes would cost  or a Bentley would cost, I'm all about that.
 Moore: Meet Peter Zalewski,  Florida's up-and-coming real estate whiz.
 Here we go.
 Moore: He calls his real estate company Condo Vultures.
 (stuttering) We have a very good sign.
 You have the final notice of eviction.
 So you can see this person was basically thrown out  by the police department.
 Welcome.
 Moore: Peter deals exclusively  with clients who buy up foreclosed homes  and then resell them at a profit.
 It's gonna be about 830 square feet or so...  At the end of the day, the only people who are buying  are primarily individuals that we represent...  Today it's on the market for $66,000.
 ...which are basically bottom feeders who are going in there.
 They have no compassion, no sensitivity.
 They're running purely off numbers They're coming in all cash,  and they're looking to slit any single seller's throat  regardless of what their situation is.
 So people always ask, "What's 25cents on the dollar?"
 This is it. This is what you're gonna get.
 The vulture basically represents a bottom feeder  that goes in there and cleans off a carcass.
 Because they're dealing with so many different germs and situations,  they'll have to vomit on themselves and there's some sort  of cleansing process that occurs.
 The vultures aren't actually killing,  they're the ones doing the clean-up.
 Which bank you want? Bank of America?
 What we do is we tap into data...  and boom, voila.
 Here we got 3,400 foreclosing by Bank of America.
 Gotta love it.
 As we collect data, it's giving us  the insight into the battlefield,  almost like a drone that flies over the battleground in Afghanistan  or in Pakistan or in Iraq.
 The current asking price is 355.
 Again, it was purchased for 840.
 A little bit of a discount. You're gonna have 2...  Our people are using that data to be able to go in  and try to steal properties, legally and ethically,  but take them at the bare-bone bottom price.
 It's all about taking right now.
 Look at the-- look at the roof-- completely gone and missing.
 We haven't had a hurricane in 5 years.
 Welcome to the housing crash, Miami style.
 So this-- this is what capitalism is  and this is why the information is so critical.
 We go in there, we alert them to it,  and if they like it, you know--  - Look at the window. - Look at that.
 Looks like the house next door was on fire.
 This is straight up capitalism.
 - Fire damage. - I wonder if somebody was living there...  Zalewski: Everybody's got this desire to go in there  and take advantage of others' misfortunes.
 Somebody asked me,  "What's the difference between you and a real vulture?"
 I said, "It's very simple. I don't vomit on myself."
 Our topic today: What is capitalism?
 Capitalism?
 Well, why should there be any question about it?
 Hasn't it given us the highest standard of living in the world?
 We're free to try to make a profit,  to just get by, or to fail.
 That's what capitalism is:
 a system of free enterprise.
 Now tell us what "free enterprise" means.
 Moore: I went to see my friend Wally Shawn,  a playwright and sometimes actor.
 Inconceivable!
 Moore: But Wally also studied history and politics  and even a little elementary economics.
 Free enterprise is a form of words  that is intended to conjure up in your mind  a little town with different shops.
 And the guy who runs the best shop  has the most customers.
 Narrator: There is the basis of the capitalistic system:
 the profit motive.
 He's in business to make money.
 Shawn: The original theory of capitalism  is that it's a very clever way  of society voting on what goods  it wants made.
 What do you use this for?
 That's-- I could use that for practically everything I ever do.
 You know, society votes.
 They like the way this guy  makes ice cream.
 But the other guy,  they don't like his ice cream that much  and they don't buy it, so it fades out.
 It's on me. That is a good fit.
 Shawn: The basic law of life is that if you have things,  you can easily get more things.
 Very quickly, one guy can have  5 times more than anybody else.
 - Free enterprise. - Competition.
 Woman: The profit motive.
 Moore: My dad, an assembly-line worker at General Motors,  bought and paid for our house  before I graduated from kindergarten.
 We had a new car every 3 years.
 We went to New York every other summer.
 That's me on Wall Street.
 And that's me directing my first movie  at the World's Fair.
 We went to Catholic schools, we lived a good life.
 If this was capitalism, I loved it...  and so did everyone else.
 During these years a lot of people got rich  and they had to pay a top tax rate of 90%.
 90%?
 Yep.
 But they still got to live like Bogie and Bacall.
 And what did we do with all their money?
 We built damns, bridges,  interstate highways, schools, hospitals.
 We even sent a guy to the moon.
 Things seemed to be going in the right direction.
 Dad had a secure job and Mom could work  if she wanted, but didn't have to.
 Middle-class families only needed one income to survive.
 Our union family had free health care and free dental.
 The kids could go to college without getting a loan from a bank.
 Dad had 4 weeks paid vacation every summer.
 Most people had a savings account and little debt.
 And Dad's pension was set aside where no one could touch it.
 It would be there for him when he retired.
 We got all of this because our main industrial competition  had been reduced to rubble.
 Here's what the German car industry looked like.
 And here's the Japanese auto industry.
 I guess you could say it's easy to be number one  when you have no competition.
 Yes, of course not everything was perfect.
 We didn't mind having to put up  with a little bit of this and a little bit of that...  just as long as we could be middle-class.
 And we could count on our kids having it better than we had it.
 It sounded like a good deal to us.
 Capitalism-- no one ever had it so good.
 And then, right when we were in the middle  of this big love affair with capitalism...  Announcer: The ABC Sunday Night Movie "The Gambler"
 will continue in its entirety  following this live report from ABC News.
 We are at a turning point in our history.
 Moore: Along came Debbie Downer.
 Too many of us now tend to worship  self-indulgence and consumption.
 Human identity is no longer defined  by what one does,  but by what one owns.
 This is not a message  of happiness or reassurance,  but it is the truth  and it is a warning.
 Moore: Wow, what a bummer.
 It was time to bring a new sheriff to town...  ...one who knew how to act like a president.
 He knew how to handle workers who wanted a better wage.
 All right, mister, I guess you win.
 Moore: Or these annoying feminists  whining about their Equal Rights Amendment.
 Well, I can change that in a hurry.
 Moore: A man who knew how to get the job done.
 Ronald Reagan came out of the B movies  to become the most famous corporate spokesman of the 1950s.
 It's a transistor radio too. Weighs only a few ounces.
 You can slip it right into your pocket.
 Boraxo waterless hand cleaner really cleans up for us.
 Moore: He had found his calling  and Wall Street had found their man.
 You see, the banks and corporations had a simple plan:
 to remake America to serve them.
 But to pull it off would require  electing a spokesmodel for president.
 And on November 4th, 1980, that's what we did.
 ...that I will faithfully execute  the office of President of the United States.
 Thank you.
 Moore: It was an historic moment  because now corporate America and Wall Street  were in almost complete control.
 See that guy standing next to the president?
 You know, the one that looks like a butler?
 His name was Don Regan,  the Chairman of Merrill Lynch,  the richest and biggest retail brokerage firm in the world.
 He took the key position of Treasury Secretary  so he could enact the tax cuts that the rich wanted.
 Regan then became White House Chief of Staff  as the president started to fade.
 Then they should give the president what 43 governors have,  a line-item veto.
 - And... - (applause)  - You're gonna have to speed it up. - Oh.
 Moore: Who tells the president to speed it up?
 The man from Merrill Lynch, that's who.
 Things in America would never be the same again.
 The country would now be run like a corporation.
 We're going to turn the bull loose.
 Moore: And 4 years later, when Reagan ran for reelection,  it was all smiley faces and happy talk.
 I really feel that we're gonna be better off in the long run.
 We're on the upward swing  and the factories are working much stronger than before.
 We're back on top.
 Moore: Actually, what Reagan presided over  was the wholesale dismantling of our industrial infrastructure.
 This was not done to save money or remain competitive,  as companies back then were already posting  record earnings in the billions.
 No, it was done for short-term profits...  and to destroy the unions.
 Millions of people were thrown out of work  and the remaining workers were told to work twice as hard.
 But wages for working people remained frozen.
 The richest Americans had their top income tax rate  cut in half.
 Instead of being paid a decent wage,  we were encouraged to live on borrowed money  until our household debt was nearly 100% of the GDP.
 There was an explosion of personal bankruptcies.
 We found it necessary to lock up millions of our citizens.
 Sales of antidepressants skyrocketed  as insurance and pharmaceutical company greed  pushed the cost of healthcare up and up.
 All of this was great news for the stock market  and for America's CEOs.
 Moore: Half of Flint was now receiving  some form of government welfare.
 During the end of the Reagan years,  I made my first movie about what had happened to the country  and specifically to my hometown of Flint, Michigan,  the birthplace of General Motors.
 GM was posting profits of over $4 billion  while at the same time eliminating  tens of thousands of jobs.
 I went to see GM's chief lobbyist in Flint, Mr. Tom Kay,  to ask him why this was happening.
 General Motors wouldn't be doing anybody any service if it goes bankrupt.
 It has to do what it has to do  in order to stay competitive in today's economic climate.
 Moore: Even if that means eliminating 18,000 jobs?
 Even if it means eliminating 20,000 jobs.
 - Or 30,000? - Whatever.
 - How about all the jobs here in Flint? - It could feasibly happen.
 Moore: And it did.
 Nearly all the jobs were eliminated  and GM went bankrupt.
 Perhaps more distressing was the fact that the rest of America  was now starting to resemble Flint, Michigan.
 But there were some cities that still took pride in their greatness.
 "Come on down to Cleveland Town,everyone "
 "Come and look at both of our buildings "
 "Here's the place where there used to be industry "
 "This train is carrying jobs out of Cleveland "
 "See the sun almost 3 times a year "
 "This guy has at least 2 DUIs "
 "Our economy's based on LeBron James "
 "Buy a house for the price of a VCR "
 "Our main export is crippling depression "
 "We're so retarded that we think this is art "
 "It could be worse, though, at least we're not Detroit "
 "We're not Detroit."
 Moore: No, they're not Detroit.
 For 20 years I tried to warn GM and others  that this day was coming, but to no avail.
 Maybe now they'd listen.
 So I went down to the headquarters of General Motors  one last time to share some of my ideas.
 You don't have permission. You can't film here.
 Huh?
 You don't have permission from General Motors.
 - You can't film here. - I'm just going up to see the chairman.
 No, sir. No, sir.
 You know, I've been doing this for, like, 20 years.
 I understand, sir.
 And I have not been let into this building for 20 years,  and I think it's about time someone just let me in  and let me talk to them.
 I've got some good ideas.
 4-7 to 7-6 Bravo Area Alpha.
 Man: Go ahead.
 It's Michael Moore here to see the chairman.
 Repeat that.
 It's the filmmaker Mr. Michael Moore.
 He's here to see the chairman.
 - Gentlemen. - Yes.
 You need to get prior permission. You cannot film here, okay?
 But if I can't go in and get permission, what am I supposed to do?
 I guess they're right. Breaking up is hard to do.
 Stop that. Don't do that. Just go in the building.
 Moore: For 35 years, GM made more money than any other corporation.
 But eventually, Germany and Japan  rebuilt their car industry and produced vehicles  that were safer than ours, more fuel efficient  and rarely, if ever, broke down.
 In Germany, unions help hire and fire the board of directors  so the workers have a say in what's going on.
 You see, the people of Japan and Germany  fight to make sure that even their conservative political leaders  don't destroy their middle class.
 So where exactly are we right now?
 On the day that General Motors declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy,  I went with my dad to visit the AC Spark Plug plant  where he had worked for over 30 years.
 - So you worked actually right here. - You'd have to go--  they had a ramp that took you up over that, just beyond that...  - Just beyond that space there? - Yeah.
 - And then the factory was all over there? - Yeah.
 Moore: The whole complex is, like, 2 miles long.
 I remember Mom bringing us kids in to pick you up.
 - 2:30 every day. - Yeah, uh-huh.
 You'd walk out of there, right over in there in fact.
 And we'd be waiting in the car for you  and we'd see you come down the ramp.
 We got real excited every time we saw you.
 I was there 33?years.
 - 33?years? - Uh-huh.
 Moore: What's your best memory here, being here, working here?
 My best memory? I think the people.
 They were a really good bunch.
 - You liked the crowd you worked with? - Yeah.
 Frank Moore: A good place to work. I enjoyed it.
 But I'm sorry to see it go.
 Moore: Shortly before Christmas 2008,  Republic Windows & Doors in Chicago, Illinois,  abruptly fired its entire unionized workforce  of over 250 people.
 They were given only 3 days' notice.
 Bank of America would no longer provide  a line of credit to the company,  and so the workers were not paid the money owed to them.
 Man #1: My life revolves around this job.
 I live according to my obligation to my job, you know?
 And it's not just me, it's all of the workers here.
 We go above and beyond  the call of duty for Republic.
 And at the end,  Republic cares nothing for us.
 Man #2: We found out that they're gonna shut the plant on Tuesday.
 We don't deserve what they're doing to us, you know?
 It really hurts because, like I said,  this is my second family.
 So it was-- it really hurts. It really hurts.
 I'm gonna miss all of them, you know?
 I'm gonna miss them and I don't think  anybody on this planet  deserves what they've done to us.
 Moore: Scenes like this were being repeated  all over the country, and no one seemed to mind.
 "Zambezi, Zambezi "
 - "Zambezi, Zam." - Woman: Whoo!
 Moore: The president was enjoying his final year in office.
 But as the economy started to fall apart,  he decided it was time to roll out the C word.
 Capitalism is the best system ever devised.
 Moore: Huh. Really?
 Voices from the left and right are equating the free enterprise system  with greed and exploitation and failure.
 Moore: Hmm, greed,  exploitation, failure?
 Go on, I'm listening.
 Capitalism offers people the freedom to choose  where they work and what they do...  Reporter: Pat Andrews has been looking for work.
 Every morning she scans the classifieds in vain.
 There isn't anything in here.
 I'm not gonna be a gentleman's club hired dancer either.
 ...the opportunity to buy or sell products they want.
 Reporter: Tom Rendon has avoided layoffs at his sign company in Stockton, California,  all because this one word now makes up for half his business.
 If you seek social justice and human dignity,  the free market system is the way to go.
 Moore: And for those seeking justice in Pennsylvania,  free enterprise was definitely the way to go.
 Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,  has one of the highest rates in the state  of young people locked up in the juvenile home.
 Perhaps it's because the good people here  employ the practices of capitalism in dealing with their wayward youth.
 The county hired a private profit-making corporation  with a sweet-sounding name, PA Child Care.
 It was owned and run by 2 businessmen,  one of whom was Robert Powell, an attorney and entrepreneur.
 His good friend Judge Conahan  closed down the public juvenile home  and then got PA Child Care to build  an $8 million privately-owned facility  and charge it back to the county for a mere $58 million lease.
 Let's meet some of Wilkes-Barre's juvenile delinquents.
 Magee smoked pot at a high school party.
 I was very rebellious when I was at this age.
 Moore: Matt, he got into an argument at the dinner table.
 I threw a piece of meat, as in steak,  cooked dinner, at my mother's boyfriend.
 Moore: Jamie got in a fight at a shopping mall with her best friend.
 I just figured, you know, we just weren't gonna be friends anymore.
 Moore: And Hillary made a MySpace page  making fun of her assistant principal  for being strict and having no sense of humor.
 And it said some pretty silly, like, 14-year-old-girl stuff.
 Moore: Her assistant principal called the police.
 They all appeared before kindly Judge Mark Ciavarella.
 These kids were about to get their first lesson in American capitalism:
 time is money, lots of money.
 I went in front of the court, in front of Mr. Ciavarella,  and I wasn't even in front of him for 4 minutes.
 I was only in front of him for, like, 2 minutes.
 Hillary: The first thing that Judge Ciavarella said to me was,  "What makes you think you can do this kind of crap?"
 I'm sure he knew in his mind when I walked in  that he was locking this kid up no matter what.
 He didn't even look at me.
 Once I entered the courtroom, I didn't have any chance.
 There was about 6 kids who went in front of me.
 Every single kid who went in front of Ciavarella,  for all different reasons-- some minor, some serious--  got sent away.
 Moore: Although Wilkes-Barre is located in the United States of America,  here capitalism trumped democracy.
 Robert Powell, one of the owners of PA Child Care,  cut a business deal with Judge Conahan and Judge Ciavarella.
 Judge Ciavarella then stepped up his conviction rates.
 Many of these kids were funneled  into PA Child Care's for-profit juvenile facility.
 And for their troubles,  the judges received over $2.6 million  while the owners of PA Child Care received tens of millions  of taxpayer dollars from the county.
 And where did Powell go to enjoy all that money?
 On his private plane  and his yacht, the "Reel Justice."
 6,500 children were unjustly convicted.
 It was good business while it lasted.
 Reporter #1: 2 Luzerne County judges in big trouble with the law.
 They're going to jail.
 Reporter #2: Some kids were locked up  even when probation officers objected to detention.
 In there you lose track of time and you lose track of the date.
 I was barely keeping track.
 It was supposed to be, like-- I believe it was, like, 2 months.
 And it went from 2 months to 9 months.
 He said originally 3 to 6 months,  but somehow I ended up being there 11 and a half months  and I never went back in front of the judge at all  for him to give me extensions.
 Moore: Not only did PA Child Care  pay off the judges to fill their cells,  but their employees were the ones who got to decide  when a child had enough rehabilitation.
 But that makes sense, because any time a governmental unit  turns over to a profit-making corporation  the duties it should be performing,  what do you expect to happen?
 Matt: It makes me feel like an item that they just used  to just get money and then tossed me aside.
 I'm just trying to work on my flying  and just trying to prepare for my future  so I can put this all behind me, finally be done with all this.
 During the whole trial I wasn't in control at all,  but with flying it's only me.
 It's just that I just get to do everything by myself.
 I'm the only one on the control.
 Moore: Matt loves to fly  and hopes to become a pilot someday.
 If he does, he'll get his 2nd lesson  that in America, sometimes you're better off  working at Mickey D's.
 - (applause, cheering) - Remember Sully?
 Captain Sullenberger,  who safely landed an airbus in the Hudson River  - saving the lives of 150 passengers? - (patriotic music playing)  - Man: A true American hero. - (applause)  Moore: He met the mayor. He went to the State of the Union.
 Heck, he even went to the Super Bowl.
 And then he went to Congress.
 Sullenberger: Flying has been my lifelong passion.
 But while I love my profession,  I do not like what has happened to it.
 - (music halts) - It is my personal experience  that my decision to remain in the profession I love  has come at a great financial cost to me and to my family.
 My pay has been cut 40%.
 My pension, like most airline pensions, has been terminated.
 So please do not think I exaggerate when I say that I do not know  a single professional airline pilot who wants his or her children  to follow in their footsteps.
 Moore: Whoa, you cleared the room with that one, Sully.
 I don't think the congressmen wanted to hear that stuff.
 - They like you as a hero. - The current experience...  Moore: What was your starting pay as a pilot?
 I made $19,000 the first year.
 I was bumped up to about 22,000 or 23,000 the second year.
 Last year, gross pay  I made $17,600.
 There's a joke in the airline when we get our wings pinned on us  as new-hire airline pilots that the company just kinda says,  "Hey, don't apply for food stamps in your uniform."
 Moore: I don't know about you, but I want the pilot  who's got me 30,000 feet up in the air to be paid really well  and not sitting up in the cockpit digging through the pilot's seat  looking for loose change.
 There was a period of about 4 months  where I was on food stamps.
 - You were on food stamps? - Yes.
 - And you were still flying the plane? - Yes.
 With my-- with my food stamp card.
 The lady I talked to in the food stamp office,  when I told her I was a pilot, she didn't bat an eye,  but she didn't-- I knew she didn't believe me.
 Moore: How have you gotten by? How have you been able to afford things?
 Relying on credit cards to buy the groceries at times  - when I wasn't on food stamps. - Oh, really?
 I have about $10,000 in credit card debt  just on the necessities,  not on the big-screen TV and the stereo.
 Moore: You're using it to buy your groceries and get by.
 - Yes. - Do you have any student loan debt?
 - Yes. - How much?
 Mine is about 80,000.
 - I took out $100,000. - Moore: Student loans?
 And by the time I pay it back, at this rate,  it'll probably cost me well over a half a million with interest  and fees and penalties.
 It's something that I don't-- I don't like to spend a lot of time  thinking about because it's abysmal.
 It's one way that I get down really quickly  about my chosen career field  is to think about how much I owe and how little I make.
 Moore: Have you had to work a second job to make ends meet?
 I walk dogs on the side,  I distribute MonaVie Juice.
 I have known pilots to donate plasma  for extra cash.
 - You mean they give blood? - They-- well--  So they can make extra money even though they're flying an airplane?
 Yeah. They donate their plasma.
 So they get the blood back, but you can get paid for plasma.
 - (chuckles) - Oh, I see.
 They suck the blood out of you, take the plasma...  - Give you the blood back. - ...give you the--  Oh, well then, not such a bad deal.
 The only reason people stay flying is because they love it.
 And managements take advantage of that.
 The airlines have managed to farm out  a lot of the flying to commuters  in an effort to basically bust the unions.
 You can't compete  to a lower and lower level every year  without skimping on safety somehow.
 Moore: At approximately 10:15 PM on February 12, 2009,  Continental connection flight 3407  began its descent to the airport in Buffalo.
 Man: Stand by, there's some ground communication,  either state police or sheriff's department.
 We need to find out if anything is on the ground.
 This aircraft was 5 miles out, and all of a sudden  we have no response to that aircraft.
 All I could tell you is there was an aircraft over the marker  and we're not talking to them now.
 Moore: No one survived the crash  and 50 people lost their lives.
 The media focused on the actions of the pilots.
 Reporter: Captain Marvin Renslow and First Officer Shaw  were chatting about their careers.
 Moore: "Careers" is a euphemism  for what the pilots were really talking about:
 how little they were paid and how overworked they were.
 There would be no discussion in the media  about why we have an economic system  that allows a pilot to be paid less than a manager at Taco Bell.
 Reporter: First Officer Shaw  made between $16,000 and $20,000 a year  and at one point worked a second job.
 Moore: Her second job had been waitressing  at a coffee shop.
 How are these companies able to get away with this?
 (laughs) I guess that's the point of capitalism.
 It allows you to get away with anything,  like making a profit off the death of an employee.
 Sweetie, I can open it. Let's try it with this.
 Moore: This is Irma Johnson.
 Irma's husband Dan worked in middle management  at Amegy Bank in Houston, Texas.
 - Wanna try to spread it? - No.
 Moore: Dan recently died of cancer,  leaving behind Irma and their 2 sons.
 But unbeknownst to Irma, Amegy had taken out  a secret life insurance policy on Dan's life.
 The bank generously named itself as the beneficiary  in the event of Dan's death.
 The insurance company then accidentally informed Irma  that Amegy Bank had received a check for $1?million  just weeks after Dan died.
 Thank you for helping.
 Johnson: They never told me.
 I wanted to find out, well, why did they purchase a policy for him?
 - Moore: You didn't know about it? - No.
 And they named themselves as the beneficiary.
 Yeah.
 Moore: So your husband's death  made them $1.5 million richer?
 Mm-hmm.
 I know it's not right for them to try to profit  from my husband's death.
 When I first realized what was happening,  I was in disbelief.
 - It's hurtful. - I'm so sorry.
 Um...  it's hurtful and I wanted answers.
 Moore: Irma contacted Michael D. Myers,  a local attorney who had already been looking into  these kind of corporate insurance policies on their employees.
 With the normal use of life insurance, where you're guarding against  the loss of a loved one or a breadwinner of the family,  you don't want that person to die.
 With these policies, the companies that buy these  want the employees to die  in accordance with the policy projections.
 You are more valuable dead to a company than alive.
 American Greetings, RR Donnelly & Sons, and Proctor & Gamble  are all having problems with mortality.
 These 4 combined programs are running at 50%  of expected mortality.
 These clients are acutely aware of this problem.
 Basically here the broker is complaining  that not enough employees are dying.
 And therefore the investment returns are not matching the projections.
 The broker writes that NCC is running  at 78% of expected mortality.
 Okay, so 78% of the people we expected to die died.
 But the problem with that is 3 of them were suicides.
 And you can't count on that every year.
 Moore: Can you think of any other situation  were you'd actually want people to die?
 Combatants in war, I guess.
 Wow, when do you want people to die?
 I-I don't know.
 War situations, terrorism situations.
 Drug trials, perhaps. I don't know.
 I don't know. That's an odd question.
 Moore: I didn't understand how any of this could be legal.
 After all, there's a reason that there's a law  prohibiting me from taking out a fire insurance policy on your house  because I have a vested interest in your house burning down.
 Since Attorney Myers had been researching this for years,  I asked him which companies were profiting  from these insurance policies.
 I don't know, you don't know,  because there's no place you can go and find out  whether your company is a purchaser  - of these types of products. - Which ones do you know?
 The ones that we know that have slipped out are  Bank of America, Citibank,  Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie, Proctor & Gamble,  McDonnell Douglas, Hershey,  Nestlé, AT&T, Southwestern Bell, Nestl? AT&T Southwestern Bell,  Ameritech, American Express--  - This is blue chip you're talking about. - Yeah.
 These aren't fly-by-night companies trying to do a scam here  so they can collect a check if one of their employees dies.
 There are probably several million Americans  who are covered by one of these policies or have been at some point.
 There's a lot of it out there.
 Moore: This is Paul Smith.
 He used to be what is known as a loyal employee.
 Smith: I worked for Wal-Mart for 18 years and I gave them 110%.
 I mean, I loved that company.
 And as it turned out, Wal-Mart took out  over 350,000 life insurance policies  on rank and file associates.
 These weren't executives.
 These were people like my wife, a cake decorator for 18 months.
 That's the type of people they were taking insurance policies out on.
 Moore: Paul's wife LaDonna left her job at the Wal-Mart bakery  so she could be a stay-at-home mom for her 2 kids.
 Smith: She had asthma real real bad.
 She went into the emergency room one night  and a nurse comes out and says, "Are you Mr. Smith?"
 And I said, "Yes."
 And she said, "We don't think your wife's gonna make it."
 Moore: LaDonna slipped into a coma  from which she would never awaken.
 Her family rushed to the hospital,  even though there was nothing they could do to help.
 There was a wall here and LaDonna's in the room  on the other side of the wall.
 And Jessica kept saying, "Where is she?"
 And I said, "She's right on the other side of that wall."
 And Jessica said, "Can we cut a hole in the wall  so that we can see her?"
 And that just sticks with me.
 Do you remember that?
 Smith: We had to stay in there with her, and so we'd write letters to her.
 "My dear wife, I miss you more than any words can possibly say.
 You are my life.
 You always see beauty in the simplest things.
 I've always admired you for that. I wish I could have told you that more.
 I want you to come back to me soon.
 I still have a lot left to learn from you, baby doll.
 Your loving husband, Paul."
 You okay, Wesley?
 She was 26 years old.
 LaDonna: You're silly. You're silly.
 Myers: The younger a person is, the higher the benefit is  because they're expected to live longer.
 Women are also expected to live longer than men.
 So the most valuable employee to the company  if they're dead, is a young woman.
 Moore: LaDonna's death earned  one of the richest corporations in the world  an extra $81,000.
 I was faced with over $100,000 worth of medical bills  and a $6,000 funeral  and Wal-Mart didn't offer a penny to help with that.
 I did trust them.
 And never in a million years would I have ever thought  that somewhere on a profit statement,  "Dead associate, $81,000."
 Wal-Mart doesn't care about you.
 When someone passes away,  they shouldn't get something out of it.
 Myers: The common denominator to each form of coverage  is that when the employee dies,  the employer gets paid the insurance benefits.
 They're often referred to as "dead peasant insurance."
 Moore: Dead peasants? Why'd they use such a creepy name?
 Myers: It's very creepy. I don't know what it means either.
 Dead is clear.
 That's the worker who's passed away, so they're dead.
 Peasant, I don't know why they chose that word.
 I don't know if it has some historical significance  or that's just the way they view the relative value  of the employees' lives.
 Dead peasants?
 Yeah, amongst themselves that's what they call it.
 It's insulting to refer to my husband like that.
 Moore: It turned out that Amegy Bank  had a second dead peasant policy on Dan,  bringing their total take to nearly $5 million.
 - Is capitalism a sin? - Father Dick Preston: Yes.
 Capitalism for me and for many of us  at this present moment is an evil.
 It's contrary to all that's good. It's contrary to the common good.
 It's contrary to compassion.
 It's contrary to all of the major religions.
 Capitalism is precisely what the holy books,  our holy books in particular, remind us is unjust  and in some form and fashion,  God will come down and eradicate somehow.
 Moore: This was Father Dick Preston,  the priest from Flint who married my wife and me.
 Preston: Capitalism is wrong,  and therefore has to be eliminated.
 Moore: Eliminated?
 That might be a little harsh,  so I decided to go and talk to the priest  that married my sister and brother-in-law.
 I'm sure he would have a more balanced approach  when it came to capitalism.
 It is immoral, it is obscene, it is outrageous.
 You know...  it is really radical evil.
 It's radically evil.
 Moore: Wow, does their boss know that they're talking like this?
 I thought it best to go and check this out with the bishop.
 Bishop Thomas Gumbleton: The system doesn't seem to be  providing for the well being of all the people.
 And that's what makes it  almost in its very nature  something contrary to Jesus who said,  "Blessed are the poor, woe to the rich."
 That's right out of St. Luke's gospel.
 Moore: How have we put up with this system for so long?
 I mean, it's-- they talk about--  The system has built into it what we call propaganda.
 I'm in awe of propaganda--  the ability to convince people  who are victimized by this very system  to support the system and see it as good.
 We know that American capitalism is morally right  because its chief elements--  private ownership, the profit motive  and the competitive market-- are wholesome and good.
 They are compatible with God's laws and the teachings of the Bible.
 Moore: For as long as I can remember,  I've been told that competition and profit are good things.
 (distorted) They are compatible with God's laws  and the teachings of the Bible.
 Moore: And if increasing profits means locking up a few kids  or cashing in on the death of an employee...  (distorted) Compatible with God's laws and the teachings of the Bible.
 Moore: ...it is morally right to provide for the stockholders.
 (distorted) They are compatible with God's laws  and the teachings of the Bible.
 Moore: Debt, eviction and exploitation.
 (distorted) God's laws and the teachings of the Bible.
 Moore: What were we really pledging our allegiance to?
 (distorted) The profit motive.
 Moore: And so all good Americans came to act as if they believed  our capitalist economic system was compatible  with the teachings of the Bible.
 When I was a kid, I wanted to be a priest.
 It wasn't because of the fancy getups  or the Knights of Columbus escorts,  or even the groovy nuns who were so good to me.
 It was because of the priests who went on the march from Selma,  or tried to stop the war,  or devoted their lives to the poor.
 They told me quite clearly what Jesus said,  that the first shall be last and the last shall be first;  That the rich man will have a very hard time  getting into heaven;  That we will be judged by how we treat the least among us;  And that there are no people more important to God  than the poor.
 Since that time, it seems that Jesus got hijacked  by a lot of people who believe that the son of God  was sent here to create heaven on earth for the well-to-do.
 I must have missed that part of the Bible  where Jesus became a capitalist.
 Man: Please tell me, master,  what must I do to have eternal life?
 Go forth and maximize profits.
 You say the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,  but when exactly will it come?
 When you deregulate the banking industry.
 - (voices overlapping) - Help me.
 I've been this way for 20 years.
 I'm sorry, I cannot heal your pre-existing condition.
 He'll have to pay out of pocket.
 Moore: Somehow, I don't think Jesus came to earth  so he could ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
 And yet, from the very beginning,  the rich have claimed him for their own.
 When I'm on Wall Street and I realize  that that's the very nerve center of American capitalism,  and I realize what capitalism has done  for working people in America, to me that's a holy place.
 Let me add to it.
 Over the whole duration of the Iraq war and the terror war,  you look at the world's stock markets and you look at the world economy,  and despite these horrible pockets of unrest and killing and murdering  that we've been describing, it's never been better.
 The global economy has never been better  and the global stock markets have never been better, Jimmy.
 It is either a God-given miracle  or it has something to do with the victories  of the spreading world of capitalism or both.
 Moore: They think Wall Street's a holy place.
 What do you think Jesus would think of capitalism?
 I think he would simply refuse to--  to be part of it.
 Moore: Jesus would refuse to be part of it,  but he probably had a special place up there  for whoever leaked a secret Citibank memo  about their plan to rule the world.
 Back in 2005 and 2006,  Citigroup wrote 3 confidential memos  to their wealthiest investors about how things were going.
 They reached the conclusion that the United States  was no longer really a democracy,  but had become a plutonomy--  a society controlled exclusively by and for the benefit  of the top 1% of the population  who now had more financial wealth  than the bottom 95% combined.
 The memo gloated about the growing gap between rich and poor  and how they were now the new aristocracy  and that there was no end in sight for the gravy train they were on.
 There was, though, one problem.
 According to Citigroup,  the most potent and short-term threat  would be societies demanding  a more equitable share of the wealth.
 In other words, the peasants might revolt.
 Citigroup lamented that the non-rich  might not have much economic power,  but they do have equal voting power with the rich.
 One person, one vote.
 And that's what really scares them--  that we can still vote.
 In fact, we have 99% of the votes  and they only have 1%.
 So why do the 99% put up with this?
 According to Citigroup, it's because the majority of the electorate  believe that someday they will have a chance  of becoming well-to-do themselves  if they just keep trying hard enough.
 The wealthy were pleased that so many people  had bought in to the American Dream  while they, the rich, had no intention  of ever sharing it with anyone.
 I think capitalism is a lot more important than democracy.
 I'm not even a big believer in democracy.
 I always say that democracy is-- can be 2 wolves and a sheep  deciding on what to have for dinner.
 Moore: This is Stephen Moore-- no relation--  a columnist and an editorial board member  of "The Wall Street Journal,"
 the daily bible of corporate America.
 Look, I'm in favor of people having the right to vote  and things like that, but you know there are a lot of countries  that have the right to vote that are still poor.
 Democracy doesn't always lead to a good economy  or even a good political system.
 With capitalism, you are free to do what you want,  to make whatever you want out of yourself.
 It doesn't mean you're gonna succeed.
 Remember, the US Constitution does not guarantee happiness.
 Moore: Ah, the Constitution.
 All my life I've heard that America is a capitalist country.
 So I went to see the original Constitution and check out if it was true.
 I'm trying to see where it sets up our economic system,  like where it says we have a capitalist economy.
 Guard: The jurisdiction.
 - Judicial part of the-- - Down there?
 Moore: There was no mention of free market or free enterprise  or capitalism anywhere.
 In fact, all I saw was "We the people,"
 something about "a more perfect union,"
 and "promoting the general welfare."
 Welfare, union, we?
 That sounded like that other -ism.
 But no, that's democracy.
 And I began to wonder, "What would it be like  if the workplace was a democracy?"
 There's always been a big separation between how the country is run  and how businesses are supposed to run.
 Moore: It's true.
 There seems to be a disconnect  between our professed love of democracy  and how we're so willing to accept a dictatorship  every day we show up to work.
 It's not that way at Isthmus Engineering in Wisconsin.
 They design and build robotic machines for industry.
 It's a $15 million-a-year business.
 Man: All of the workers  are the owners of the business.
 Moore: He's not talking about some bullshit stock option.
 He means they're the true owners.
 Man: And it's a democratically-run operation where every member  has one vote and an equal say.
 - All in favor? - All in favor?
 Man: It takes the money out of the equation.
 Moore: By taking the money out of the equation  so that they can call the shots,  they end up making more money.
 Cool, huh?
 And how patriotic that they want to extend  their love of American democracy to their job.
 Just imagine if the place where you worked  was run by you and your fellow workers.
 You probably wouldn't lay off your coworkers  to increase the value of your stock, would you?
 Or give yourself a pay raise  while making your coworkers take a pay cut.
 Man: We don't really do that here.
 You really can't because everyone else would be looking at you  saying, "Why is this guy so fricking greedy?"
 You know, it would be too obvious.
 The bottom line is you've got plenty of people  who roll up their sleeves every day and go to work.
 But if there's someone way up there on the chain  that collects all the extra money, that's not fair.
 Moore: Huh, fairness in the workplace--  what a novel idea.
 Out in California, there's a bread factory  where workers make thousands of loaves of bread every day  Man: The more hours you work towards  the benefit of the co-op,  the more you share in the profits.
 Man #2: The workers are happy here.
 No big Is, little yous. Everyone's the same.
 Me as the CEO, I get the same share  that anybody else does.
 And that has proven  to be very lucrative for us as workers.
 Moore: Assembly-line workers here earn over $65,000 a year,  more than 3 times the pay  for a starting pilot at American Eagle.
 Man: I'm just hoping that people take notice  of this type of organizational activity  and start considering it as an alternative.
 Why do you want to get rich?
 How many cars do you really need in life?
 Moore: Clearly, he's not a car guy, but that's okay.
 His bread factory and hundreds of other worker-owned businesses  are proof that people aren't always motivated by profit.
 Announcer: An historic victory over a dread disease.
 Moore: Instead of using his genius to make a ton of money,  Dr. Jonas Salk spent all of his time  putting monkey kidneys in a blender  trying to find a cure for polio.
 And when he did, he decided to give it away for free.
 This man could have been rich many times over  had he sold his vaccine to a pharmaceutical company.
 But he thought his talents should be used  for the greater good.
 And the decent salary he made as a doctor  and a research professor was enough for him to live  a comfortable life.
 Who owns the patent on this vaccine?
 Well, the people, I would say.
 There is no patent. Would you patent the sun?
 Moore: Yes, we've come a long way since the days of Dr. Salk.
 Because today our best minds are used for something else.
 Where do we send our top math and science people?
 Into finance.
 They don't go into science in America.
 They go to Wall Street.
 Moore: Today's students, unlike in Dr. Salk's time,  can graduate from college with a student loan debt  of up to $100,000 or more.
 These students are then beholden to the banks  for the next 20 years.
 And the best way for them to pay off these banks  is to go to work for them  instead of working for the common good.
 Black: We've taken people that could be enormously productive--  just what we're short of in America--  and we take them and we put them in an activity  that isn't simply less productive,  but where they're actually destructive;  where actually every day they work, they make the world worse.
 Moore: So what exactly were the top students from Harvard  and other schools working on these days?
 Derivatives... derivatives... derivatives... derivatives...  Credit default swaps.
 I can't make any sense out of this.
 I might as well quit.
 Moore: That's exactly how I felt  when I started hearing these new terms.
 So I went down to the New York Stock Exchange to get some answers.
 Sir, can you explain derivatives to me?
 Can anybody explain derivatives or credit default swaps?
 Can someone explain to me what these are?
 Sir, can you tell me what a credit default swap is?
 Can you explain a derivative to me?
 Can you tell me what a derivative is?
 - Nobody'll talk to me. - I'm just a blue-collar guy.
 I can see that. Hey.
 - I'm looking for some advice. - Yeah, good.
 You guys got any advice for me here?
 A derivative? Credit default swap?
 Moore: I did find one guy on Wall Street  who wasn't a film critic.
 Marcus Haupt is an Ivy League educated engineer  who was a vice president of Lehman Brothers  and spent 15 years on Wall Street  creating what they call complex financial instruments.
 What is a derivative?
 A derivative is a secondary bet  on an underlying product.
 So you may have a stock and you have an option on that stock.
 And that option on that stock allows you the privilege  but not the obligation to buy or sell.
 How should we put this? You are allowed to make a decision  of whether or not you want to ultimately take that exposure.
 Let me explain it another way. The derivative's price  is based on the price of something else.
 It's kind of like a second-degree equation.
 If you think of, let's say...  um, maybe I should go back.
 Let me start this over again. Let's go back here.
 Moore: I was lost.
 Maybe there's someone at Harvard University  who could explain it to me.
 Yeah, the-- the-- the--  the-- the-- the-- the buyer--  so the seller holds the loan and it might default.
 And they sell off--  somebody-- somebody else--  Sorry, let me just back up.
 I apologize. These are pretty exotic.
 Moore: Derivatives are nothing more  than complicated betting schemes.
 Here's what the math equation of one looks like.
 Can't figure it out?
 That's okay. You're not supposed to.
 They've made them purposely confusing  so they can get away with murder.
 Let's say you're a lawyer and you're coming in  and you're from the government and you're trying to evaluate  if these things violate the tax code or not.
 If you can figure out what they're doing,  most likely that Wall Street firm will offer you a job.
 Could I go to Wall Street and just ask them  to set up a derivative on anything?
 Yes.
 Believe me, if it's out there  there's a derivative on it.
 Moore: So this is what Wall Street has come to--  an insane casino.
 We've allowed them to bet on anything,  including our family home.
 Reporter #1: ...the most powerful central banker of the 20th century.
 Reporter #2: Greenspan has become an economic icon.
 Reporter #3: Alan Greenspan says the economy is hunky-dory.
 Reporter #4: Greenspan gone wild. It's like "Girls Gone Wild."
 What do Mick Jagger and Alan Greenspan have in common?
 Alan Greenspan, who at that moment in time  was surely thought to be the smartest man  who had walked the face of the earth,  he starts using a phrase, "tap your home equity,"
 --that Americans can tap their home equity,  which is just Alan Greenspan-speak  for "borrow against your home."
 And if you can't repay it you'll lose your house.
 It actually started by talking mostly older Americans,  people who already had homes,  into refinancing their homes  to get them out of houses.
 Moore: Yes, get senior citizens out of their houses.
 The scam to swindle people out of the homes  they already owned was masterful.
 Here's how it worked.
 First, tell these homeowners that they own a bank.
 And that bank is your home.
 So if your home is worth $250,000,  that makes you a quarter millionaire.
 You're sitting on a goldmine.
 You own your own bank.
 The bank of you.
 And you can use your bank to get more money.
 Just refinance.
 Everyone's doing it.
 Of course hidden in the dozens or hundreds of pages of fine print  are tricky clauses that allow the bank to raise your interest rate  to a number you didn't know about,  perhaps so high that you won't be able to repay your loan.
 But that's okay.
 If you can't pay it we'll just take your house.
 Of course, before they could take your house  they needed to change the regulations and the rules.
 Moore: What's this photo I found here?
 It was in an annual report of the FDIC.
 John Gilleran, the head of the Office of Thrift Supervision,  which is supposed to regulate savings and loans,  he's the guy with the chainsaw.
 And the 4 other grinning idiots  in the photo are the 3 leading lobbyists in banking  and the deputy director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 And they're poised over a pile of regulations.
 And this is supposed to demonstrate  their intention to destroy regulation.
 And they succeeded.
 And now we know what happens  when you destroy financial regulation.
 You produce a financial catastrophe.
 A growing family with a lot of debt;  A young couple with no down payment;  A business owner whose income was hard to document;  Every one of them was turned down for a home loan  by 3 different lenders.
 I'm with Countrywide and I got them all approved.
 Moore: Don't be fooled by the pleasant demeanor  and blonde hair.
 It's the same pitch the mafia gives you  in the neighborhood.
 (imitating Brando) I know how you feel.
 You got a lot of debt.
 You don't have any money for the down payment.
 You can't find your documents.
 It's okay. I'll make you a loan you can't refuse.
 It's called subprime.
 You pay no interest now.
 You pay a little more later.
 Don't worry about later. We'll take care of you.
 And like the mafia, Countrywide,  Citibank, Wells Fargo, Chase...  Let's go.
 ...they would someday stop by to collect  and take your home.
 Randy Hacker: I was paying 1,700 a month and making it.
 Then it went to 2,000. Then it went to 2,300.
 Then it went to 2,700.
 Can't do it.
 Moore: These are the Hackers of Peoria, Illinois.
 Randy is a railroad worker  and Donna works for retirement homes.
 Their farm, which had been in the family for over 4 decades,  had been foreclosed on by Citibank.
 Randy had had an accident on the job years ago  and was now on disability.
 They absolutely just plain fucking stole everything,  my whole life's savings and everything,  by a stroke of a pen and a lawyer and a judge.
 Moore: The Hackers showed me the foreclosure notice from Citibank.
 What caught my eye  was the town from which their mortgage came.
 It turns out that a company owned by the big banks  has chosen to run 60 million mortgages through,  of all places, one of the most desperate towns  in the United States.
 This company hires the people of Flint  to send out nearly 60%  of all the foreclosure notices in the country.
 In what seems to be some sort of cruel joke,  my hometown was now in the service  of helping to turn the rest of America  into Flint.
 Typically when a bank forces a family like the Hackers  out of their home they hire professionals  to come and clean up the place.
 In this case, the bank figured,  why pay top dollar when we've got a desperate family  who will work cheap?
 In a final humiliation  the Hackers went to work for the bank  that took their home.
 Donna: "Property is to be turned over in broom-clean condition  with all trash, debris and personal property removed.
 Upon delivery of the keys  the PAS representative will hand you a check for $1,000."
 Randy: You know, 1,000 bucks  to get out of my own house and stuff,  I really want to thank them. That was really something.
 My wife worked for a week to clean the house up  and make sure it was presentable to somebody else.
 I'm glad they did that. I have to thank them.
 It was awful nice of them.
 Yeah, I'd like to thank them all right.
 I have one more.
 Oh, that goes to our bedroom door.
 Trying to think what--  that goes that that. I had a lock on it  to keep kids out 'cause I have guns.
 And here's your money, Randy.
 Moore: What you're witnessing  is a robbery.
 I'm starting to understand why people,  they lose their minds and start shooting people.
 I'm not gonna say I would do something like that,  but I can see how they get people  into that situation where  people go in there with bombs and blow them up  and shoot at them.
 Anything that happens to them people, they deserve it,  is all I can say.
 I hope something happens--  yeah, well.
 Can't say no more.
 Some roadkill right there.
 Moore: This is Bob Feinberg.
 He handled all the VIP loans for Countrywide,  the nation's largest mortgage company.
 Although Countrywide mainly specializes  in outrageously high interest loans for low income people,  Bob's job was to take care of  some of the country's top political leaders.
 Bob: One day one of the bigger bosses called me in the office.
 He said, "I want you to call this guy."
 I said okay.
 And he said, "He's a friend of Angelo's."
 Angelo Mozilo's the CEO of Countrywide.
 "Give him this rate. Waive these fees.
 And get it locked in. And don't fuck it up."
 And I was like, "Oh, okay."
 So it was a special department  that handled friends of Angelo.
 Discounts were being given.
 Fees were being waived.
 And at times paperwork was being waived.
 We literally would write on the file "FOA."
 These were really important people.
 I had Richard Holbrooke-- Ambassador Holbrooke,  Donna Shalala,  people on Capitol Hill, people that regulate the mortgage markets,  people that regulate Wall Street,  and Jim Johnson, head of Fannie Mae,  Alphonso Jackson the secretary of HUD...  Senator Conrad from the Finance Committee.
 I had the TV on in my house. I was in the kitchen  and I heard a voice pontificating  about predatory lending and how we have to put an end to it.
 Our nation's financial regulators  are supposed to be the cops on the beat  protecting working Americans  from unscrupulous financial actions.
 Bob: Senator Dodd-- Christopher Dodd-- was speaking.
 And I just stared at the television and I was upset.
 Some of these loans have legitimate uses,  when made to sophisticated borrowers  with higher incomes.
 I had done a number of loans for him  in which he got discounts and all the things  that go with being a friend of Angelo's  and all the good stuff.
 Moore: The Senate Banking and Housing Committee  is supposed to be the watchdog of the mortgage industry.
 Senator Dodd is the chairman of this committee  and has served on it for over 28 years.
 As a friend of Angelo  he received over $1 million worth  of discounted loans from Countrywide.
 Someone next door here is selling a toxic  piece of crap loan to somebody.
 I was required to give the most suitable loan to that VIP.
 Moore: Did you ever feel that  what you were doing might be bribery?
 Bob: I didn't feel like I was bribing anybody, no.
 I was just doing my job. I was the VIP guy.
 Everyone in the company knew who I was.
 You know, everyone.
 So it was kind of a flattering situation.
 But no, I don't feel like I did anything wrong at all.
 And if I didn't do it, somebody else would have been doing it.
 Moore: That's why we need people like Bill Black,  one of the bank regulators who uncovered  the Savings & Loan scandal in the 1980s.
 Something improper happened  and I bet you the regulators know.
 Moore: One of the leading figures of that scandal, Charles Keating,  had an idea on what to do with Bill Black  and sent a memo out with these instructions.
 I asked him who was looking out for us today.
 Where was the FBI in all of this?
 The FBI began publicly warning  in September 2004  that there was an epidemic of mortgage fraud  perpetrated by the banks.
 Epidemic was their word.
 But when 9/11 hit,  the Bush administration transferred  at least 500 white-collar FBI specialists  out of dealing with white-collar crime,  even though we were entering  during the entire Bush administration  the greatest wave of white-collar crime  in the nation's history, in fact, in the world's history.
 The FBI says that 80%  of the mortgage fraud losses  are induced by lender personnel.
 Meaning what?
 Meaning not the borrower  coming off the street trying to defraud the savings and loan.
 These are frauds led by whoever controls the organization.
 - Right. - It's typically the CEO in other words.
 So did these CEOs think they were gonna get away with it?
 They have gotten away with it.
 Moore: Yes, apparently they did.
 And with the presidential election just around the corner...  - Define rich. - 5 million.
 ...the elites were worried that their crime spree might come to an end.
 After bilking trillions from the American public  by repossessing their homes,  bankrupting them when they got sick  and convincing them to invest their earnings  and pensions in the casino known as the stock market,  the rich decided to make one last heist  and as their 30-year long party came to an end,  take as much of the silverware with them as they could.
 But first they needed a distraction.
 And as they learned after 9/11,  nothing works better in the home of the brave  than some good old fashioned fear.
 And who better to wheel out for one last scary performance  than Chicken Little himself?
 Oscar voters, for your consideration.
 Good evening.
 This is an extraordinary period for America's economy.
 The government's top economic experts  warn that without immediate action by Congress,  America could slip into a financial panic  and a distressing scenario would unfold.
 More banks could fail, including some in your community.
 - (thunder rumbling) - The stock market would drop even more,  which would reduce the value of your retirement account.
 The value of your home could plummet.
 Foreclosures would rise dramatically.
 And if you own a business or a farm,  you would find it harder and more expensive to get credit.
 More businesses would close their doors  and millions of Americans could lose their jobs.
 - (screams) - Even if you have good credit history,  it would be more difficult for you to get the loans you need  to buy a car or send your children to college.
 And ultimately our country could experience  - a long and painful recession. - (people screaming)  Fellow citizens, we must not let this happen.
 Moore: In reality there was no need for this speech,  because the mainstream media  had already drunk the Kool-Aid.
 Meltdown. The American financial system  is rocked to its foundation.
 The giant bank crumbles, stocks plummet.
 - Nightmare on Wall Street. - AIG fights for its life.
 - Blood on the floor. - Armageddon.
 A category-5 test of our financial levies.
 What the fuck happened?
 Have you ever seen a dam fail?
 It starts with a little crack, a little seepage.
 Reporter: With overwhelming support,  Congress struck down the restrictions.
 Big banking is barreling back.
 Black: And it starts eroding  and it destroys all the internal strength of the dam.
 Reporter: Poison from the housing mess  seeped deeper and deeper into the banking system.
 Black: And soon the dam works against itself.
 The weight of the dam and the weight of the water  conspire against it.
 Reporter: Investors were dumping Bear shares  leading a huge selloff...  Reporter #2: The stocks of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  were in freefall this morning...  Black: Then there's kind of a significant flow.
 Reporter: Wall Street's losing streak stretched into its 7th day.
 Black: And then suddenly you've got 60-70 foot sections.
 Merrill Lynch, sold in haste.
 - Now AIG. - Black: Just crashing.
 Reporter: The market's year long slide  has brought down some of the biggest blue chips.
 Black: The water starts rushing through.
 Reporter: This morning, Washington Mutual has gone under,  the largest failure in US banking history.
 Reporter #2: Stocks fell off a cliff.
 The largest single point drop in history.
 Black: It destroys the rest of the dam.
 And the whole failure  looks like it only takes 2 minutes.
 But of course, it's that little hole  that's been there for several years  that really destroyed it.
 You have this fundamentally unsound system  built on a foundation of sand  instead of bedrock.
 And it was rotted from the core.
 It seems like capitalism is just collapsing on itself.
 Who got rich here?
 Lots of people got rich during this time,  primarily the officers and directors  of the large banks and savings and loans  and the specialty non-prime lenders.
 These people became unbelievably rich.
 And members of Congress got rich,  especially once they left Congress.
 A number of them go and work in the financial institutions.
 Sure, and as do Rubin and Summers.
 Moore: Robert Rubin, a one-time top executive  at both Citigroup and Goldman Sachs  champion a change in the law  that allowed commercial banks to get into new areas  like investment banking and exotic insurance products.
 This made it legal to let Citicorp  merge with Travelers Group,  a deal valued at $70 billion,  creating the world's largest bank.
 After leaving the Clinton administration,  Rubin worked for Citigroup,  earning more than $115 million.
 Summers made his money where?
 Summers made his money as a supposed consultant  and in giving speeches  at apparently, in some cases,  over $100,000 a pop.
 Moore: Summers also made $5.2 million at his part-time job,  advising a hedge fund.
 Where did Geithner work?
 Geithner has been a failure  at pretty much everything he's done in life.
 Most of the institutions that destroyed the economy  were under his direct regulatory authority.
 How did he get the job as Treasury Secretary?
 By completely screwing up his job  as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 That makes no sense.
 Of course, it makes perfect sense.
 This is not new to Washington.
 People who will give you the wrong answer  but the answer you want are invaluable.
 And they often get promoted  precisely because they're willing to say  and do absurd things.
 These are the people that promised us  that financial deregulation would make all of us rich.
 And these are the people who were personally made rich.
 Moore: It was not surprising that the rich wanted to get richer.
 But now they had come up with a new and brazen way to do it.
 Just back a big truck up to the Department of Treasury  and take $700 billion of our tax money,  no questions asked.
 I got Michael Moore here. You know who Michael Moore is, don't you?
 The film director. He's filming me right now.
 - I got my wife on the line. - Oh, hi.
 How are you doing? Baron Hill from Indiana.
 How are you, sir? Good state.
 - We're from Michigan you know? - Yeah.
 How did this collapse happen?
 I got home on a Friday, everything was just fine in terms of the economy.
 I call back after my plane landed in Indiana  just to check in with my office,  and all of a sudden we've got this crisis on our hands  and that I'm gonna have to vote when I come back Monday  for a multibillion-dollar bailout of the financial industry.
 The word that we got was that if we did not act immediately  the economy would collapse, no doubt about it.
 I felt that the announcement  of this crisis in September,  just a few weeks before election,  was very suspicious.
 This is when Congress is the most nervous.
 And I thought, "Wait a minute. What's going on here?
 This is not normal."
 Moore: The leadership of Congress  and the Bush administration  quickly held a series of private meetings  with the titans of Wall Street to figure out  just how much money was needed to cover  all the bad bets investors had made.
 A deal was cut with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson,  the former CEO of Goldman Sachs,  whose net worth was estimated at $700 million  when he left Goldman to go and run the Treasury Department.
 I think we saw the best of the United States of America  in the Speaker's office tonight.
 Moore: The best of America?
 Or did he mean the best of Goldman Sachs?
 The Treasury Department,  it's basically an arm of Wall Street.
 All the people in charge were from Goldman Sachs.
 We call it Government Goldman in the modern era.
 Moore: That's because there were now numerous  former Goldman executives inside the Bush Treasury Department,  as there were under Clinton.
 They worked as powerful lobbyists from the inside  to abolish financial regulations  while we paid their salaries.
 Black: Treasury Secretary Paulson--  he wasn't just randomly at Goldman.
 He was the guy at Goldman who got them big time  into buying these exotic housing derivatives.
 So he got Goldman in a huge amount of trouble.
 Moore: Insane housing derivatives  had now destroyed much of Goldman's competition.
 And with the Goldman boys now calling the shots  inside the government, they would ensure that Goldman  would end up as the kings of Wall Street  when the dust settled.
 Black: So the last possible people  that should be giving advice to Treasury would be Goldman.
 So naturally Paulson,  former CEO of Goldman, puts them on.
 And what advice do they end up giving?
 Well, to use the taxpayers  to bail out Goldman  and other favored financial institutions.
 Well, Secretary Paulson has submitted  a simple proposal to Congress.
 This is it-- 3 pages.
 It's about $1 billion a word.
 And it is quite simple.
 Secretary Paulson gets the key to the treasury.
 He's gonna start off by borrowing $700 billion  in the name of the American people,  maybe more later. And it waives all laws.
 All laws!
 Not even court review. Pretty simple proposal.
 We are in a real crisis situation  that could mushroom  into something worse than the Great Depression.
 So I saw fear. One gentleman started to cry.
 People are telling us that it's going to be this gigantic calamity.
 And I'm up for election in 2 months.
 8 weeks away from election,  I don't want to make a mistake. What's the right thing to do?
 Heaven help us.
 If we fail to pass this  I fear the worst is yet to come.
 And a few members were even told  that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.
 They were ramming this thing down our throat.
 They wanted us to vote on it right away  without any kind of thoughtful analysis.
 - No real hearings? - No real hearings.
 And I wasn't about to--  I got cornered into voting  for the Iraq resolution based upon some lies  that they made to me and I wasn't going to go through that again.
 I will not wait on events while danger is gathering.
 I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer.
 Use fear and then you get done what you want.
 And they created in this window--  2 months before election-- this pressure cooker.
 People understand that the House of Representatives  needs to pass this piece of legislation.
 Mr. Speaker, my message to the American people...  don't let Congress seal this Wall Street deal.
 These criminals have so much political power  they can shut down the normal legislative process  of the highest lawmaking body in this land.
 All the committees that should be scanning  every word of what is being negotiated are benched.
 And that means the American people are benched too.
 We are constitutionally sworn  to protect and defend this republic  against all enemies foreign and domestic.
 They say it's gonna be Y2K all over again.
 This is the same politics of fear we are hearing  from the fat-cat financial bullies from Wall Street.
 Why aren't we asking Wall Street to clean up its own mess?
 Why aren't we helping American families faced with bankruptcy?
 Why aren't we reducing debts from Main Street instead of Wall Street?
 Is this the United States Congress  or the board of directors of Goldman Sachs?
 Moore: The night before the vote  the American people in unprecedented numbers  flooded Capitol Hill with millions of messages  demanding that Congress vote no.
 The bailout package was defeated today,  voted down in the House of Representatives.
 The stock market plunged--  plunged to the single greatest point loss  in the Dow average in one day ever.
 The question is this:
 is the failure of the bailout reason enough  to vote all the incumbents out of office in 5 weeks?
 12 votes killed it.
 So did the voices of a lot of the American people  who called their representatives and said no.
 Then Congress voted no.
 Tonight Congress has left town.
 Moore: It was a rebuke that Congress and Wall Street  had rarely, if ever, experienced.
 It was what the Citibank memo had warned against:
 That if the peasants ever chose  to exercise their democratic rights,  the pillaging by the wealthy would be over.
 So Paulson and company headed back up to Capitol Hill.
 And faster than you can say "Check, please,"
 they cut a backroom deal with the help of the Democrats.
 This issue supersedes an election.
 We need to get this right. We need to do it quickly.
 I agree with the secretary.
 It's not gonna openly cost all these hundreds of billions.
 We will recover most of it, maybe all of it.
 Kaptur: The Democrats became  the delivery man for a bill  for the Republican president.
 The presidents and presidents- to-be made phone calls  and members-- I know at least 2 members  who have an interest in the US Senate,  and promises were made.
 Moore: Within days, the Congress  did an amazing about-face  and gave the banks the 700-plus billion they wanted,  the people be damned.
 On this vote the yeas are 263,  the nays are 171. The motion is adopted.
 It was very carefully planned to happen when it did,  to involve the players that it did.
 The message was carefully handled.
 They had Congress right where they wanted them.
 You don't think it was just happenstance?
 No.
 This was almost like an intelligence operation  that had to be coordinated at the highest levels.
 This whole fiasco shows you  that there are some forces--  That are not democratic.
 Right. That are in control.
 Big time.
 They did a masterful job. Very well executed.
 Do you think it's too harsh  to call what has happened here a coup d'état?
 A financial coup d'état?
 No, because I think that's what's happened.
 - A financial coup d'état?  - Yeah.
 I could agree with that.
 I could agree with that because the people here  really aren't in charge.
 Wall Street is in charge.
 Where's our money?
 I don't know.
 Reporter: Citigroup is spending $50 million  on a luxury corporate jet.
 You don't know? But you're the person--  you're in charge of-- they put you in charge to find out.
 Reporter: Goldman Sachs has set aside  6.8 billion for bonuses.
 But Treasury followed a don't-ask-don't-tell policy.
 They didn't ask the banks  what they were going to do with the money.
 And not having asked them, the banks are not required to tell.
 AIG poolside meetings at a Valley resort... We getting words that 73 people  received at least $1 million apiece.
 Why would the Department of Treasury  not require the banks to tell them  what they're doing with our money?
 You're going to have to ask Secretary Paulson that question.
 Because I've asked that question  in my role as head of the Congressional Oversight Panel,  and so far I haven't gotten an answer. Maybe you'll get a better one.
 Woman: Good afternoon. Hank Paulson's office.
 Yeah, this is Michael Moore.
 I'd like to talk to Mr. Paulson.
 - I'm sorry. Your name again? - Michael Moore.
 - Michael Moore? - Yup.
 - (hangs up) - Hello? Hello?
 This is crazy what they're doing with our money.
 If I could get them to actually give the money back--  I'd be in favor of that.
 We're here to get the money back for the American people.
 I understand, sir, but you can't come in.
 - Can you just take the bag? - No.
 - Take it up there? - Absolutely not.
 Fill it up. I got more bags.
 10 billion probably won't fit in here.
 You can't help you get the money?
 I can't help you get the money.
 What would happen if I made a run for it right now?
 Moore: So I went to another bank.
 We want our money back.
 I went to all the banks.
 - You've seen this guy? - Yeah.
 Okay, we're here to make a citizen's arrest, actually.
 Just drop it from the windows.
 And everywhere I went...  I got the same reaction.
 We're actually here to make a citizen's arrest  of the entire board of directors and the exactives here.
 Why don't you see my supervisor?
 - That's him right here. - Where's he at?
 - In the white shirt? Blue tie? - Yup.
 - That's him. - Receding hairline?
 They're using the money to buy other companies.
 This is our money.
 Oh, this is a police officer.
 I wanted to make a citizen's arrest of the CEO.
 - Mr. Blankfein. - (chuckles)  But you're here, so maybe you could help me.
 - Let's do it outside. - $170 billion of our taxpayer money.
 - You're not allowed in the building, sir. - But I'm here to make an arrest.
 - I'm here to make an arrest. - Make it outside, sir.
 I can't make it outside. They're upstairs.
 I'll make an arrest, sir.
 You can arrest somebody?
 If you can arrest somebody, I can arrest somebody.
 Sir, leave the building, sir.
 Who else do you want to leave the building?
 Your cameraman and your crew. Come on out, sir.
 They don't speak English. Donde?
 These guys have broken so many laws, you know?
 This is money. It's theft, it's fraud.
 I'm gonna take it back to the US Treasury  right in this car.
 It's safe. You can trust me.
 There's just these little hints  that the unimaginable  could occur, which is that...  people in general  in the United States could actually  become angry  at the wealthy.
 Shame on you! Shame on you!
 Shawn: People who became rich in this country  in the last decades were not even making  the things that everybody loved.
 They were playing games  that ended up actually harming everybody.
 So some kind of disease has entered into the economy.
 Moore: It was unusual for Americans to turn against the rich  because of the carrot that had always been held out in front of us,  that we too could be one of them someday.
 People were starting not to believe that.
 And that frightened the rich.
 Because off in the distance they heard something coming  and it wasn't another dry martini.
 It was the friggin' people.
 We are ready to take this country  in a fundamentally new direction.
 That's what's happening in America right now.
 Change is what's happening in America.
 Moore: Holy shit.
 This was not what Wall Street wanted.
 What if he won?
 What would happen to their way of life?
 So they did what they always do.
 They threw as much money at him as they could.
 Goldman Sachs became his number-one private contributor  with nearly $1 million in contributions.
 But yet they still weren't sure what he would do.
 How did he really feel about them  and their way of life?
 My attitude is that if the economy is good for folks from the bottom up,  it's gonna be good for everybody.
I think when you spread the wealth around it's good for everybody.
 Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth.
 Joe the Plumber said to him  that plan sounded like socialism.
 Joe: I love America.
 I want to make sure it stays a democracy and not a socialist society.
 I really think he's gonna bring socialism if he gets half a chance.
 I don't trust Obama at all.
 I left Europe 4 decades ago  because socialism has killed opportunities there.
 "Someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie  so someone else can have more."
 I want all my pie.
 Barack Obama is a socialist, it's that simple.
 Moore: The scare campaign wasn't working.
 In fact, the more they called Obama a socialist,  the more he went ahead in the polls.
 And by using the word so much,  it made a new generation curious about what that was.
 For instance, few of them knew  there was actually a socialist in the United States Senate.
 Of course he was from the gay state of Vermont.
 You say that you're a socialist. Tell me what that means.
 I'm a democratic socialist,  which means that the function of government is to represent  middle income and working people  rather than just the wealthy and the powerful.
 One of the things that we've done here,  we've become very religious in worshipping greed.
 We put on the front pages of the magazines  guys who have made billions of dollars.
 We ignore the cops, the firemen, the teachers, the nurses  who every day are doing so much in improving the lives of people.
 We've got to change our value system.
 Moore: Hmm, that doesn't sound too bad.
 I mean, it sounds like something maybe we should try.
 Within a few months,  the Rasmussen poll reported  that only 37% of young adults  now favor capitalism over socialism.
 I hope the economy will...  At 11:00 we project Barack Obama  President-Elect of the United States of America.
Moore: Just 2 years earlier  had anyone predicted this moment,  they would have been considered crazy.
 But that's how fast things change.
 It was in an instant  a farewell to the old America.
 The country was electrified by his victory.
 And suddenly people were inspired  to do things they never would have done before.
 Like the sheriff in Detroit  who decided it was time to break the law  in order to help the people.
 Warren Evans: Doesn't it seem kind of strange to you  they would seek a government bailout? I thought that's not what they do.
 1-0-1 radio.
 I thought the free market is you sink or swim.
 I just saw them sink and cry like babies  for assistance from everybody else.
 Today I will be stopping all mortgage foreclosure sales  in Wayne County.
 I cannot in clear conscience allow anymore families  to lose their homes through foreclosure sales.
 Moore: What must the banks have thought  seeing the law that was set up to protect their interests  being subverted?
 Do you think the free market has failed Detroit?
 Well, I mean, I think that the free market failed the country.
 You know, this is crazy.
 Neighborhoods that are completely destroyed  because too many homes have been foreclosed.
 And then you wonder, is this really America  or is this a third-world country?
 Exactly what are we doing here?
 Until things get so bad that people can do nothing but protest,  and then those are called revolutions.
 Moore: And sometimes revolutions begin  in unlikely places.
 Wake up.
 Moore: Living in the back of a truck  after a bank foreclosed on the home they had owned for 22 years,  the Trody family of Miami, with the help of their neighbors,  took matters into their own hands.
 On behalf of this family and this community,  we liberate this home for this family.
 Cut the sign down. Take it off.
 - (applause) - Yay!
 When I say community, y'all say power.
 - Community! - Power!
 - Community! - Power!
 - Community! - Power!
 - Community! - Power!
 - Community! - Power!
 Moore: It wasn't long before the guy from the bank  who had evicted them came back.
 See this?
 I want you to go ahead and take a picture of that.
 You're trespassing.
 We did an eviction here and the people went back inside the property.
 Yes. So I need police assistance.
 When all these houses are empty  the value of everybody else's house goes down.
 So if you can keep these people in this house  that will help not only them...  So you see, the situation is that the people--  if the bank lets them go back inside,  then the bank misses the opportunity to sell the house to somebody else.
 The banks are selling so many houses right now.
 Well, if the bank lets everybody get back inside the house for free--  Then people will have places to live.
 Moore: People fighting back was an unusual sight.
 So 9 police cars responded to the call.
 Considering the neighborhood,  the response time was impressive.
 - You are not in charge. - I'm not saying I'm in charge.
 I'm saying she doesn't want to be isolated. You don't have to answer any questions.
 You don't have to say anything to them, okay?
 Moore: But the Trodys stood their ground.
 We don't have nowhere else to go.
 - This was the backup plan. - We're forced to live inside of a truck.
 This was our plan B. We don't have no plan C.
 That is our grandma and it's not right.
 She's been in this house for 22 years and y'all gonna put her out?
 How do you feel putting people out of their homes  every single frickin' day?
 You should rather be home instead of do something like that.
 Where is the money the federal government put in the bank?
 We should be telling you that you're trespassing because this is our house.
 "Rooted like a tree, rooted like a tree "
"We are here"
 "Stand up strong..."
 Let's go.
 - We did good. We did good. - All right.
 Moore: The police and the man from the bank were sent packing.
 Ain't no power like the power of the people.
 And the power of the people don't stop. Say what?
 Ain't no power like the power of the people.
 And the power of the people don't stop. Say what?
 Don't leave your home.
 Because you know what?
 When those companies say they have your mortgage,  unless you have a lawyer that can put his finger  or her finger on that mortgage, you don't have that mortgage.
 And you're gonna find that they can't find the paper up there on Wall Street.
 So I say to the American people, you be squatters in your own homes.
 Don't you leave in Ohio and Michigan,  in Indiana and Illinois and all these other places  where our people are being treated like chattel.
 And this Congress is stymied.
 Moore: Wow.
 It's not every day you get to see a member of Congress  encouraging open rebellion.
 Back in Chicago,  the workers at Republic Windows & Doors  had a bright idea.
 They decided that on second thought,  it wasn't okay to be fired without notice,  to be denied their vacation and severance pay  and to have their medical benefits cut off.
 So they came up with a plan.
 Tell Bank of America and the owners of the company  that it was a new day in America.
 They weren't going to leave the building  until they were paid what they were owed.
 Yes, it was a good old fashioned sit-down strike.
 Man: We understand that perhaps  some bad business deals were made.
 But guess what? We don't make business deals.
 We make windows and doors.
 Why should we be punished?
 Moore: The union organizers and the workers  prepared for a police assault that was sure to come.
 I'm gonna take the chance.
 You're prepared to be arrested?
 I am prepared to be arrested if it's necessary.
 We've been here since yesterday and we aren't going anywhere.
 We are committed to this.
 Moore: It wasn't long before the media showed up.
 And given the mood of the country toward the bailout,  even the TV anchors had run out of sympathy for the banks.
 In Chicago, a group of factory workers watched like the rest of us  as taxpayers bailed out the financial industry.
 Now these laid-off workers are demanding Bank of America  spend some of its bailout money on them.
 It says "Bank Robbers of America."
 Look, if we the taxpayers are going to provide  a bailout for companies like Bank of America,  then the least they can do is use those funds  on American workers and companies.
 Woman: $25 billion to Bank of America.
 How do people sleep at night when they act like that?
 I don't get it.
 Because what's the point of bailing them out  if there aren't any jobs?
 Moore: The strike went on day after day.
 The police had not yet come.
 But the son of a Chicago steelworker did.
 He just also happened to be the bishop in Chicago.
 Ladies and gentlemen,  I am Bishop James Wilkowski.
 I know that you are all undergoing  a great trial.
 You are teaching  to our young people  that it is just  to challenge that which is unfair.
 I grew up on the far southeast side of Chicago  and I saw what happened  when all the steel mills disappeared.
 And I saw the impact that it had  on families.
 But this time  we are with you.
 And we will not abandon you.
 In the name of the Father and the Son  and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
 The body of Christ.
 The body of Christ.
 The body of Christ.
 President Obama: When it comes to the situation  here in Chicago with the workers  who are asking for the benefits and payments  that they have earned, I think they're absolutely right.
 What's happening to them is reflective of what's happening  across this economy.
 Reporter: He said, "What's happening to them is reflective of what's happening..."
 Reporter #2: He said what is happening to those workers  is reflective to what's happening across this economy.
 I was watching Obama's press conference this morning.
 I just got out of bed and decided  the best thing I could do was to feed people.
 So I brought some food.
 - I brought some sandwiches. - Oh, good.
 Moore: In fact, lots of Chicagoans showed up to support the workers.
 Reporter: The workers have become a national symbol  for thousands of employees laid off across the country.
 Reporter #2: The sit-in has grabbed the attention of politicians  who believe it exemplifies an imbalance between a Wall Street  that gets government help and a Main Street that gets the shaft.
 Moore: The question started to be asked:
 Was this is the beginnings of a worker's revolt against Wall Street?
 The people united.
 We'll never be defeated.
 Bail out workers, not the banks. Bail out workers, not the banks.
 Moore: Pledges of financial support and food showed up by the truckload.
 Woman: It's really beyond what we had at first initially imagined.
 And so now we're dreaming a little bit.
 We even had a conversation-- well, what if we just tried  to run the factory like a cooperative?
 We don't have any money. We're not capitalists.
 We're having those kind of conversations  and the workers are thinking about it and it's a difficult thing  'cause, you know, if you've been told your whole life  that things are the way other people tell you they are,  to be able to think I can make it different  is quite a big deal.
 We're all over the national news. Everyone is watching you  because they're so inspired by you. (speaks Spanish)  Moore: After 6 days of the sit-in  Bank of America decided enough was enough.
 Better to pay off these workers now  and hope their little revolution goes away.
 And so the bank and the company agreed to all the worker's demands.
 Yes we did! Yes we did!
 The average package for each worker  will be very close to $6,000.
 But this is about more than just money.
 It's about what can be achieved  when workers organize and stand up for justice.
 Just to fight-- fight fight fight fight fight  just to get the most basic thing  that people should take for granted  and that's legally theirs.
 We just fight so hard just for the most basic things in life.
 Moore: It's a fight we knew all too well in Flint, Michigan.
 For it was here that my uncle and his fellow workers  first brought down the mighty corporate interests  that dominated their lives.
 It was the day before New Year's Eve in 1936.
 Hundreds of men and women took over the GM factories in Flint  and occupied them for 44 days.
 They were the first union that beat an industrial corporation.
 And their actions eventually resulted  in the creation of a middle class.
 But back in these days of the Flint sit-down strike,  the police and the company thugs were not going to just stand by.
 After a bloody battle one evening, the Governor of Michigan,  with the support of the President of the United States  Franklin Roosevelt, sent in the National Guard.
 But the guns of the soldiers weren't used on the workers.
 They were pointed at the police  and the hired goons,  warning them to leave these workers alone.
 For Mr. Roosevelt believed that the men inside  had a right to a redress of their grievances.
 7 years later, President Roosevelt was too sick  to go up to the Capitol and give his annual State of the Union Address.
 Ladies and gentlemen,  the President of the United States.
 It has been my custom to deliver these annual messages in person.
 Moore: So he gave it from the White House over the radio.
 When it was over he asked the newsreel cameras  to step into his room because he wanted the American people  to see one particular part of his speech.
 The President of the United States then took the radical step  of proposing a second Bill of Rights  to the Constitution.
 In our day certain economic truths  have become accepted as self-evident.
 A second Bill of Rights  under which a new basis of security and prosperity  can be established for all  regardless of station or race or creed.
 Among these are:
 The right to a useful and remunerative job;  The right to earn enough to provide adequate food  and clothing and recreation;  The right of every farmer  to raise and sell his products  at a return which will give him and his family  a decent living;  The right of every businessman large and small  to trade in an atmosphere of freedom,  freedom from unfair competition and domination  by monopolies at home or abroad;  The right of every family to a decent home;  The right to adequate medical care  and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health;  The right to adequate protection  from the economic fears of old age,  sickness, accidents  and unemployment;  The right to a good education.
 All of these rights spell security.
 And after this war is won,  we must be prepared to move forward  in the implementation of these rights  to new goals of human happiness and wellbeing.
 For unless there is security here at home,  there cannot be lasting peace in the world.
 Moore: Roosevelt would be dead in little over a year.
 He would not live to see the end of the war.
 Nor would there be any enactment of his new Bill of Rights.
 Had he lived and succeeded,  every American, regardless of race,  would have had a right to a decent job...  a livable wage...  universal health care...  a good education...  an affordable home...  a paid vacation...  and an adequate pension.
 None of this would come to pass.
 No American would be guaranteed any of this.
 But the people of Europe and Japan  got every one of these rights.
 How did that happen?
 After the war, the people of Roosevelt's administration  went overseas to help rebuild Europe.
 During this time new constitutions were written  for the defeated nations of Germany, Italy and Japan.
 The Italian constitution  guaranteed all women equal rights.
 And this was 1947.
 The German constitution said that the state has the right  to take over property and the means of production  for the common good.
 And here's what we wrote up for the Japanese.
 All workers have a right to organize into a union.
 And academic freedom is guaranteed.
 For the next 65 years  we would not become the country  that Roosevelt wanted us to be.
 Instead, we became this...  I remember thinking during the Katrina flood,  "Why is it always the poor  who have to suffer the misery?
 Why isn't it ever Bernie Madoff up on the roof  screaming for help?
 Or the head of Citibank  or the hedge fund guys at Goldman Sachs?
 Or the CEO at AIG?"
 It never is these guys, is it?
 It's always those who never got a slice of the pie  because these men took it all  and left them with nothing,  left them to die.
 I refuse to live in a country like this.
 And I'm not leaving.
 We live in the richest country in the world.
 We all deserve a decent job,  healthcare, a good education,  a home to call our own.
 We all deserve FDR's dream.
 And it's a crime that we don't have it.
 And we never will,  as long as we have a system that enriches the few  at the expense of the many.
 Capitalism is an evil.
 And you cannot regulate evil.
 You have to eliminate it and replace it with something  that is good for all people.
 And that something is called democracy.
 Crimes have been committed in this building.
 I am here to make a citizen's arrest.
 Please come down and step away from the building.
 Do not be afraid.
 Federal prison is a nice place.
 You know, I can't really do this anymore  unless those of you who are watching this in the theater  want to join me.
 I hope you will.
 And please, speed it up.

What defines "deliciousness"?
Taste is tough to explain, isn't it?
I would see ideas in dreams.
My mind was bursting with ideas.
I would wake up in the middle of the night.
In dreams, I would have visions of sushi.
Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work.
You have to fall in love with your work.
Never complain about your job.
You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill.
That's the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably.
I have published several restaurant guidebooks.
I went to every sushi, soba, tempura, and eel restaurant in Tokyo.
Nobody has eaten more of these foods than I have.
Out of the hundreds of restaurants that I ate at, Jiro's was the best by far.
When I went to Jiro the first time, I was nervous.
After going for years, I am still nervous.
Jiro has a very stern look on his face when he's making sushi.
It's comfortable for people who like to have sushi served at a fast pace.
But for people who want to drink and eat slowly while chatting, it won't be a comfortable eating experience.
All of the sushi is simple.
 It's completely minimalist.
Master chefs from around the world eat at Jiro's and say, "How can something so simple have so much depth of flavor?"
If you were to sum up Jiro's sushi in a nutshell... "Ultimate simplicity leads to purity."
Excuse me.
Yes?
Do you have a pamphlet for this restaurant?
We don't have pamphlets. We only have business cards.
Could I have one, please?
May I have one?
I came all the way from Shizuoka.
Here are a few cards.
Can I make reservations?
Reservations are mandatory here.
How early do I need the reservation?
One month in advance.
One month in advance?
Yes.
Since it's February now,we're taking reservations for March.
I see.
Reservations can be made for lunch and dinner?
Yes, for both.
The price starts at 30,000 yen.
30,000 yen?
It starts at 30,000 yen.
 Okay.
The sushi and prices vary, depending on what's available at the market.
I see.
So it starts from 30,000 yen.
Can we order drinks and appetizers to start?
We only serve sushi. We don't have appetizers.
- Really? - Yes.
- You don't have any other dishes? - No.
- Only sushi. - Yes.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
For fast eaters, a meal there might last only 15 minutes.
In that sense, it's the most expensive restaurant in the world.
But people who eat there are convinced it's worth the price.
We're not trying to be exclusive or elite.
The techniques we use are no big secret.
It's just about making an effort and repeating the same thing every day.
There are some who are born with a natural gift.
Some have a sensitive palate and sense of smell.
That's what you call "natural talent."
In this line of business, if you take it seriously, you'll become skilled.
But if you want to make a mark in the world,you have to have talent.
The rest depends on how hard you work.
He repeats the same routine every day.
He even gets on the train from the same position.
He has said that he dislikes holidays.
The holidays are too long for him.
He wants to get back to work right away.
It's unthinkable for most people.
Is it good?
Is it too firm?
Overall it's a little tough.
Is it?
Probably because it is young.
But the toughness isn't that bad.
If it doesn't taste good, you can't serve it.
It has to be better than last time.
That's why I always taste the food during preparation.
It hasn't marinated enough.
It is a bit fatty.
This doesn't taste right either.
How long has this marinated?
For about five hours.
Put it back in.
It needs work.
Let's marinate it in vinegar a little longer.
Let's marinate it again.
Put it in the vinegar again.
Put that one in the vinegar too.
We'll try it again before serving.
Okay.
I've seen many chefs who are self-critical, but I've never seen another chef who is so hard on himself.
He sets the standard for self-discipline.
He is always looking ahead.
He's never satisfied with his work.
He's always trying to find ways to make the sushi better or to improve his skills.
Even now, that's what he thinks about every day.
A great chef has the following five attributes.
First, they take their work very seriously and consistently perform on the highest level.
Second, they aspire to improve their skills.
Third is cleanliness.
If the restaurant doesn't feel clean, the food isn't going to taste good.
The fourth attribute is impatience.
They are not prone to collaboration.
They're stubborn and insist on having things their own way.
What ties these attributes together That's what makes a great chef.
Jiro has all of these attributes.
He's a perfectionist.
The difference between Jiro today and Jiro 40 years ago is only that he stopped smoking.
Other than that, nothing has changed.
When I apprenticed for him, he wasn't famous yet.
But he always worked incredibly hard.
He would only take a day off if it was a national holiday.
The only time he wasn't at the restaurant was when there was an emergency, like a funeral.
But he would still keep the restaurant open.
I would say to the customers, "Jiro is at a funeral, so I will be your chef today."
I've worked hard, so I have no regrets.
Seriously.
If Jiro has any regrets, then he's crazy!
I feel sorry for his older son.
He should let Yoshikazu take over.
Don't you think?
Yoshikazu is already 50.
Yes, he's only 12 years younger than I am.
Yoshikazu, you probably didn't think you'd be working with your father so long.
I thought he was going to retire long ago.
Everyone thought Jiro might retire 10 years ago.
He was hospitalized once when he was 70.
Then the Roppongi Hills branch was opened.
Those were the two times when he might have retired.
After he was hospitalized, we weren't sure he could continue working.
How old were you when you started training?
I started when I was 19.
You didn't like it at first?
I hated it at first.
For the first two years, I wanted to run away.
We can have them sit here and here.
But that way, Mr. Taniguchi would have to sit at seat nine.
Have these guests on seats one, two and three.
No, that won't work.
It wouldn't be fair to the people who reserved last year.
Have them sit close together  to fit the other party.
It's essential to check every detail.
What the staff might not notice, I notice because I have been doing it for so long.
I give them detailed instructions on what to do.
Working there wasn't easy.
I worked for him until he was 60.
I wouldn't say he is eccentric.
He just works relentlessly every day.
That's how shokunin are.
The way of the shokunin is to repeat the same thing every day.
They just want to work.
They aren't trying to be special.
I could always tell from his facial expressions if he was in a good mood or a bad mood.
And when it was best not to bother him.
Once your boss, always your boss.
Let's just say I don't sleep with my feet in his direction.
Remove the part with tough meat.
We'll age a small tuna for about three days.
We'll age a larger tuna for up to 10 days.
When you compare fatty tuna and lean tuna, these days most people prefer the taste of fat.
Before World War ll, they used to cook fatty tuna.
The taste of the fatty tuna is simple and predictable.
But the flavors of leaner cuts are subtle and sophisticated.
Each tuna has its own unique taste, but it is the leaner meat that carries the essence of the flavor.
We can't buy just any tuna.
The tuna vendor works exclusively with tuna.
Our shrimp vendor only sells shrimp.
Each vendor is a specialist in his field.
We are experts in sushi, but in each of their specialties, the vendors are more knowledgeable.
We've built up a relationship of trust with them.
Sushi was originally sold from street stands.
In New York, there are food vendors on the street.
Sushi was once served the same way.
It is said that the "California" roll was invented between 1983 and 1985.
Sushi's popularity spread quickly to New York... and then spread to Europe.
In France, the first Michelin guide was published in 1900.
Michelin inspectors look first for quality.
Next they look for originality, and finally they look for consistency.
Jiro's restaurant easily meets their standards.
A perfect three-star Michelin rating means it is worth making a trip to that country just to eat at that restaurant.
When Jiro got three stars, everyone was astonished.
There are only 10 seats there!
The restroom is outside the premises.
There's not another three-star restaurant in the world like that.
But the Michelin investigators say, "No matter how many times you eat at Jiro's, the sushi there is incredible." They said that three stars is the only rating adequate for the restaurant.
I've never had a disappointing experience there.
That's nothing short of a miracle.
The layout of this second restaurant is different because I'm right-handed and my father is left-handed.
The interiors are reversed.
The photo on the right is Jiro's Sukiyabashi.
This is my Roppongi.
Together, they are symmetrical.
My father's skill is incomparable.
He's been making sushi since before I was born, so there's nothing I can do to top him.
I have to lower my prices to satisfy my customers.
Some of his customers say they get nervous eating in front of my father at his place.
They say I serve the same sushi in a more relaxed atmosphere.
That's why they like coming here.
When l opened this restaurant, my father said, "Now you have no home to come back to."
He said that I would be buried in Roppongi.
Failure was not an option.
When you open your own restaurant, you need to be tough.
I told him to leave and open this restaurant because I knew he could do it.
If he weren't ready, I wouldn't have made him go.
But I felt he was ready, so I gave him a gentle push out the door.
But I told him, "There is no turning back.
You must make your own way."
When I say things like this, people often disagree.
But when I left home at the age of nine, that's what I was told.
When I was in the first grade, I was told "You have no home to come back to.
That's why you have to work hard."
I knew that I was on my own.
And I didn't want to have to sleep at the temple or under a bridge, so I had to work just to survive.
That has never left me.
I worked even if the boss kicked or slapped me.
Nowadays, parents tell their children, "You can return if it doesn't work out."
When parents say stupid things like that, the kids turn out to be failures.
I don't know much about my parents.
I don't know much about my father.
This is me.
It's 1927 or 1928.
They had a professional photographer come just to take this picture.
So, back then, my father was making money.
He made good money taking people on boat rides.
But his business failed and his life fell apart.
All he did was drink.
Later, he went to work at a military factory in Yokohama.
I heard that he died.
But I didn't go to the funeral.
I lived with him until I was seven.
I never heard from him again.
I was on my own after that.
Our father started as an apprentice and was paid almost nothing.
According to our mother, when they got married they only had 10 yen in their bank account.
That's how poor we were.
I remember when Coca-Cola in cans first came out.
All the other kids were drinking Coke, but we were so poor we didn't get to drink it.
Back then, in most canned drinks the flavors were on the bottom.
I thought you had to shake the can.
I shook it, and when l opened it the liquid burst out.
We had saved up for months!
My brother was furious.
Less than half the liquid remained in the can.
I felt so sorry.
Even now, he probably thinks about it.
I still feel guilty.
When the kids were small, Takashi would say, on the rare occasion that I was at home sleeping in on a Sunday, "Mom, there's a strange man sleeping in our house!"
It's a true story.
I would get up at 5:00 in the morning and go to work.
I would get home after 10:00 at night when he'd be asleep.
When they were young, I didn't get to see them often.
I wasn't much of a father.
I was probably more like a stranger.
Our father was always strict with himself.
We hold ourselves to the same standard.
I let them graduate from high school.
Then they wanted to go to college, but I convinced them to help out at my restaurant.
They didn't go to college.
It's difficult to maintain a restaurant and it's difficult to leave and start your own.
It's normal to be competitive when you're younger.
You need competition in order to improve.
But if we both were to continue working at our father's restaurant, when he retires only one of us could be the head chef.
And I don't think I'm inferior to my brother just because I was born later.
Were you jealous when Takashi started his own restaurant?
In Japan, the eldest son succeeds his father's position.
That's what is expected of me.
We came back to work after World War ll.
The masters said that the history of sushi is so long that nothing new could be invented.
They may have mastered their craft, but there's always room for improvement.
I created sushi dishes that didn't exist back then.
I would make sushi in my dreams.
I would jump out of bed at night with ideas.
How did you serve shrimp before?
Like everyone else, we boiled it in the morning and put it in the refrigerator.
And then we took it out when it was time to serve.
It was a lot easier back then.
Now we wait to boil the shrimp until the customer arrives.
It's more work, but it's worth it.
Octopus is another example.
I always felt that my preparation was decent.
But I've since refined my technique.
Back then, I would massage the octopus for about 30 minutes.
Now it is massaged for 40 to 50 minutes.
It's hard work for the apprentices.
Too often, octopus tastes like rubber.
It has no flavor.
We massage it to give it a soft texture.
To bring out the fragrance of the octopus, we serve it warm.
Shokunin try to get the highest quality fish and apply their technique to it.
We don't care about money.
All I want to do is make better sushi.
I do the same thing over and over, improving bit by bit.
There is always a yearning to achieve more.
I'll continue to climb, trying to reach the top, but no one knows where the top is.
Even at my age, after decades of work, I don't think I have achieved perfection.
But I feel ecstatic all day.
I love making sushi.
That's the spirit of the shokunin.
When to quit?
The job that you've worked so hard for?
I've never once hated this job.
I fell in love with my work and gave my life to it.
Even though I'm 85 years old, I don't feel like retiring.
That's how I feel.
When Jiro retires or when the inevitable happens, sushi may never reach that level again.
But if Yoshikazu carries on his father's legacy and continues Jiro's style of only making the finest sushi, other chefs may follow his lead and restaurants that focus only on sushi may still flourish.
It's not going to be easy for Yoshikazu to succeed his father at the same restaurant.
Even if Yoshikazu makes the same level of sushi, it will be seen as inferior.
If Yoshikazu makes sushi that's twice as good as Jiro's, only then will they be seen as equals.
That's how influential his father is.
Sometimes, when the father is too successful, the son can't surpass him.
The first place I worked at was a famous restaurant.
But when the son took over, all the customers left and didn't come back.
It will be difficult.
I don't have anyone to take over for me.
Jiro's ghost will always be there, watching.
I think it will be difficult when Jiro departs.
I wish my father could make sushi forever.
But at some point I'm going to have to take his place.
People tell me that I should preserve what my father has built.
We've gone through a lot to maintain the integrity of this restaurant.
I must continue my father's tradition.
Jiro stopped going to the fish market at the age of 70.
He collapsed while smoking a cigarette.
He had a heart attack.
It was after that he stopped going to the market.
He felt that if he continued to go, he wouldn't be able to pass the torch to his son.
So the heart attack was a catalyst for Yoshikazu to start going to the market.
He's the undisputed champ.
That's not true.
They did a TV special about him and even showed a re-run!
I'm humbled that Jiro respects my taste.
My methods and standards are a little unusual compared to other vendors.
It is encouraging that he trusts me.
I'm what you might call "anti-establishment."
I either buy my first choice, or I buy nothing.
If 10 tuna are for sale, only one can be the best.
I buy that one.
The first impression is very important.
We have to predict what a fish will be like based on experience and instinct.
I dig out a piece of the tail and examine it.
By checking the texture with my fingers, I can tell how good it will taste.
This is the basic process of choosing the fish.
Not good.
People are saying there are a lot of tuna here.
This is nothing.
How is the halibut?
Good and fresh.
Okay, good.
His grandfather was known as "the god of sea eel."
He was a legend.
I never met him in person, but that's what I've heard.
Do you have octopus?
Yes.
Today's octopus is from...
- Sajima? - It's from Yokosuka.
Was the color too dark?
I don't care about the color.
It just has to taste good.
The flavor is all that matters.
This one is two kilograms,and this one is a little smaller.
We are picky about who we sell to.
We want customers who appreciate good fish.
Even at my age, I'm discovering new techniques.
But just when you think you know it all, you realize that you're just fooling yourself and then you get depressed.
You must hold the shrimp firmly.
Put pressure on them.
If you hold them gently, they'll try to escape.
Very few shrimp came in today.
They don't have any.
They didn't sell out. No shrimp came in.
Just tell them that we sold out.
There were only three kilograms of wild shrimp in this whole market.
That's all.
Everybody thinks we always have shrimp, but it's hard to find them.
Sometimes, when I see the shrimp in the morning, I'll say, "Ah, this is worthy of Jiro."
That's the way I do business.
It's not about the money.
These days, young people want an easy job.
They want lots of free time and they want lots of money.
But they aren't concerned with building their skills.
When you work at a place like Jiro's... you are committing to a trade for life.
Most people can't keep up with the hard work and they quit.
Have there been a lot of cases like that?
People often suddenly quit and disappear.
They'll just leave without notice.
What's the shortest an apprentice has lasted?
One day.
Really, one day.
They come in the morning, but by night they are gone.
I've always loved anything fast.
I wanted to become a fighter pilot, but they don't accept people with bad vision.
Then I wanted to be a race car driver, but I didn't have enough money.
You need a sponsor because race cars are so expensive.
When I was a kid,I was sure I would be an F1 racer.
You're a speed freak?
Yes, I'm crazy.
My car can go 300 kph.
Hello, Sho-chan.
They wanted nappa and mulukhiya cabbage.
How are you doing?
Not doing too well.
I want to retire.
You don't want to work?
I'm exhausted, but your dad is working so hard.
Yeah, he's working hard. He's working harder than I am.
He's full of energy.
Thank you. I hope you feel better.
When you work for Jiro, he teaches you for free.
But you have to endure 10 years of training.
If you persevere for 10 years, you will acquire the skills to be recognized as a first-rate chef.
It's sad to see that there are no very young apprentices at Jiro's.
Taking 10 years to learn the necessary skills is a long time compared to other fields of work.
When did you want to become a sushi chef?
I was about 17.
I needed a job but couldn't decide what to do.
I wanted to do something with food and sushi is the coolest food.
That's how I decided.
I went to several restaurants, .
but the sushi here was the best So I applied for the job.
The atmosphere was different too.
This place has an interesting vibe.
I came here to eat by myself when I was 24.
The place made me nervous.
Did Jiro make you sushi?
No, it was you.
Oh, really?
I was so nervous eating here.
I don't remember that at all.
Now you guys are all fulfilling your dreams.
Maybe you think you made the wrong decision.
Okay, let's get to work.
Everybody works to please Jiro.
All that matters is Jiro's approval.
Jiro is like the maestro of an orchestra.
When you first sit down at Jiro's they give you a hand-squeezed hot towel.
An apprentice must first be able to properly hand squeeze a towel.
At first the towels are so hot, they burn the apprentice's hands.
It's very painful training, which is very Japanese.
Until you can adequately squeeze a towel, they won't let you touch the fish.
Then you learn to cut and prepare the fish.
After about 10 years, they let you cook the eggs.
I had been practicing making the egg sushi for a long time.
I thought I would be good at it.
But when it came to making the real thing, I kept messing up.
I was making up to four a day.
But they kept saying, "No good, no good, no good."
I felt like it was impossible to satisfy them.
After three or four months, I had made over 200 that were all rejected.
When I finally did make a good one Jiro said, "Now this is how it should be done."
I was so happy I cried.
It was a long time before Jiro referred to me as a shokunin.
I wanted to shout, "You just called me a shokunin, didn't you?"
I was so happy that I wanted to throw my fist into the air!
But I tried not to let it show.
That's what you strive for after all these years.
After Nakazawa opens his own place, Takeshita and Masuda will be promoted to Nakazawa's position.
The work that Takeshita and Masuda were doing will be taken over by newcomers.
I'm in charge of tasting.
You should slice the fish thinner.
The rest is okay.
Make sure you slice the fish thinly.
Only apply gentle pressure.
He gives me advice. Yoshikazu says, "Press the sushi as if you are pressing a little chick."
A chick?
Right, a baby chicken.
You don't want to squash it.
But there is much you can't learn from words.
I have to keep practicing.
There's too much wasabi.
It's making me cry.
I'm sorry.
- You just grated the wasabi, right? - Yes.
Okay, good job.
He needs time to grow.
There is still a long way for him to go, but I think he will improve.
It depends on how hard he works.
In order to make delicious food, you must eat delicious food.
The quality of ingredients is important, but one must develop a palate capable of discerning good and bad.
Without good taste, you can't make good food.
If your sense of taste is lower than that of the customers, how will you impress them?
When I think of someone with a highly acute sense of taste and smell, the first person I think of is the great French chef Jol Robuchon.
I wish I were as sensitive as he.
I have a very good sense of smell, but he's on another level.
His sensitivity is very high.
If I had his tongue and nose, I could probably make even better food.
He knows everything about rice.
He's different from the other dealers.
He knows so much.
That's why we trust him.
However, sometimes he seems so knowledgeable that I get suspicious he's making it all up!
The hotel near Takashi's restaurant came to me.
I told them certain rice can only be prepared by Jiro's disciples.
It was the Hyatt Hotel.
Oh, the Grand Hyatt.
They asked you for our rice?
I told them, "No way!"
I said even if I wanted to sell it to them... only Jiro knows how to cook it!
If Jiro told me to sell it to them, I would, but I can't sell it to them just because they ask for it.
Everybody loves our rice.
But if they can't cook it, what's the use?
It takes significant skill to cook this rice.
What's the point of buying rice that you can't cook?
It's not so easy, is it?
You can't cook rice like this just with big talk.
We put a lot of pressure on the rice.
The lid itself is so heavy that it takes two hands to lift.
And then we place a big pot of water on top.
With the type of rice we use,you need a lot of pressure.
I can't think of any other restaurant that puts this much pressure on the rice.
But that's fine with us, because we can keep using the best rice and our rivals won't be able to imitate us.
The temperature of the rice is very important.
Most people think sushi is cold.
But actually, the rice should be served at body temperature.
We've devised techniques to maintain the perfect temperature when serving.
The temperature and freshness of the fish are crucial.
Each ingredient has an ideal moment of deliciousness.
Mastering the timing of sushi is difficult.
It takes years of experience to develop your intuition.
The sushi must be eaten immediately after it is served.
To explain umami... it takes more than just a good piece of tuna to create the sensation of umami.
It's when... You eat it together with vinegared rice and soy sauce.
The umami is brought out through the balance of the flavors.
For example, when you drink a good beer, you'll exclaim "Ahh!" after you drink it.
That's a form of umami.
Or when you take a bath, you say "Ahh!" because it feels good.
The most important part of making good sushi is this:
creating a balance between the rice and the fish.
If they are not in complete harmony, the sushi won't taste good.
The order is also important. In traditional Japanese cuisine, there is a progression in how the dishes are served.
Heavier flavors are served later in the course.
There is an ebb and flow to the menu.
For 10 years, Jiro pondered ways to incorporate this concept into his menu.
Seven years ago, he formed the structure of the tasting course that he serves today.
From all the fish at Tsukiji market, he chooses the highest quality fish and creates the course menu of the day.
I was lucky enough to be the first person to try this menu.
When I ate the sushi, I felt like I was listening to music.
Jiro's sushi course is like a concerto.
The meal is divided into three movements.
Classic items, like tuna and kohada, are presented in the first movement.
The items in the second movement are fresh catches of the day.
Certain items that can only be found seasonally are served.
Some of the fish is raw, while some is cooked.
The second movement is like an improvisation.
It's like a cadenza.
In the third movement, sea eel, kanpyo and egg comprise a traditional finale.
There are dynamics in the way the sushi is served,just like music.
You're consuming Jiro's philosophy with every bite.
He's watching us much more closely than we're watching him.
I make the sushi different sizes depending on the customer's gender.
If I made everybody's the same size, it would disrupt the pace of the meal.
So I make the sushi a little smaller for the ladies so everybody finishes at the same time.
That's incredible.
If the men and women are seated randomly,does it make things difficult?
The first thing we do is memorize the seating arrangement.
If Jiro notices a guest using his left hand, the next piece of sushi will be placed on the left side.
So you adjust accordingly for that guest.
I'm left-handed, so l understand how left-handed people feel.
That's so considerate.
Jiro is making more sushi now than ever before.
Before, customers would start with drinks.
And then they would eat appetizers.
Then they would eat four or five sushi at the end.
And then they would be full.
Now l only make sushi from start to finish.
I make 20 pieces per person.
Jiro is the oldest chef to have been awarded three stars by Michelin.
He's in the Guinness Book of World Records.
Nobody in their 80s is working day and night like Jiro.
Jiro was given the Meikou Award by the Japanese government.
He went to the award ceremony during the day and was back at work here in the evening.
He said he got tired of sitting around.
When we have good tuna, I feel great.
While I'm making the sushi, I feel victorious.
That's how it makes me feel.
Thank you for the delicious meal.
Take care of yourself!
Thank you very much.
The sushi was so delicious.
Thank you very much.
Until the end, l only want to work with the best fish.
Yoshikazu and I have meetings at night.
I tell him what I want for the next day.
He sometimes tells me that there isn't any good fish available, but he still comes back with enough fish for one day.
I first noticed that good seafood was becoming scarce when the akagai started to disappear.
And then the good hamaguri disappeared.
It used to be easy to get good anago, but now they're gone.
If you have a sushi restaurant, you'll have to find substitutes for certain types of fish.
But is there a substitute for tuna?
I don't think so.
Back when I was younger, there was never a shortage of high-quality fish.
In the past, when I would go to the market, I could see the big tuna that were just cut open and I would ask them to bring out the ones I liked.
That was true for any fish.
You can't find fish like that anymore.
When we were kids, sushi was too expensive to eat regularly.
Now they have sushi on conveyor belts and in convenience stores.
Sushi is available everywhere, which has caused a shortage of fish.
The problem is over-fishing.
The tuna stocks are declining each year.
It takes 10 years for them to weigh 100 kilograms.
Net-fishing and bottom-trawling methods catch everything, even the young fish.
Regulations on catching only bigger fish should be enforced.
Catching the smaller fish before they've matured lowers the overall numbers.
Businesses should balance profit with preserving natural resources.
Without fish,we can't do business.
However, that doesn't mean they should catch all the fish to the brink of extinction.
For posterity,we must be conscious of this issue.
Welcome!
It has been awhile.
How are you doing?
How are you?
I'm doing great!
We're still alive!
What are you saying?
This is my oldest son.
He looks just like you.
Thank you for gathering.
When Jiro and this guy were in the first grade, they were infamous troublemakers.
I wasn't a bully.
He was.
He was the number one troublemaker.
I was number two.
Later, when you were at school, I was delivering lunches for military draftees.
She brought all her friends to the window, they all looked down at me and she yelled, "He's the one who bullied me!"
I said, "I'm not just bullying her, I'm bullying everyone!"
They'll get mad at us if we go in.
You're not supposed to clap your hands at a Buddhist temple.
Of course. Did you know that?
Yes, you don't clap in a Buddhist shrine.
You're going to get in trouble.
It's okay, I'm not doing anything bad.
Where is everybody?
I haven't been here for a long time.
- The flowers are dead. - Yes, they are.
Just water them.
I guess we were supposed to bring flowers.
Maybe next time.
I don't know why I come here. My parents didn't take care of me.
You shouldn't say things like that in front of your ancestors.
You'll be punished.
Lots of spider webs.
When I was in school, I was a bad kid.
Later, when I was invited to give a talk at the school, I wasn't sure if I should tell the kids that they should study hard or that it is okay to be a rebel.
I wasn't sure what advice to give the kids.
Studying hard doesn't guarantee you will become a respectable person.
Even if you're a bad kid, there are people like me who change.
I thought that would be a good lesson to teach.
But if I said that bad kids can succeed later on like I did, all the kids would start misbehaving,which would be a problem.
Always doing what you are told doesn't mean you'll succeed in life.
There were customers today that came to eat after seeing us on TV.
I am usually the one on TV and I'm the one making the sushi, which is what the customers expect.
They think that Nakazawa just carries the fish from the kitchen.
Customers think that all Yoshikazu does is cut the fish.
They think the staff in the kitchen has it easy.
And they think the master making sushi has the hardest job.
But in reality, the sushi is 95% complete before the fish is brought out to me.
So the guy who is doing the least work gets to take all the limelight.
I entrust all the preparations to these guys.
I'm in the luckiest position right now.
Customers still think that he does all the preparations.
They probably do.
They think he still does everything.
But if you think about it, they're all just doing what I taught them.
Is sushi easily misunderstood?
The person making the sushi is almost like a performer.
It is misunderstood that way.
Compared to tempura or soba chefs, sushi chefs are more interesting to watch.
That may be true.
It's like the sushi chef is on a stage.
That may be true.
My job is the easiest!
If I don't keep working, my body will become worthless.
If my body stops functioning, then I will have to quit.
Or if I look too hideous to be here, then I will retire.
It's not up to me.
If the customers see me and think that I look too senile... if that's what people think, then I will have no choice.
If I stopped working at 85, I would be bored out of my mind.
I would be kicked out of the house.
My wife would kick me out for being such a nuisance.
I have been able to carry on with the same job for 75 years.
It's hard to slow down.
I guess I'm in the last stretch of the race.
The Michelin inspectors said,"Jiro's sushi is incredible every time."
They said, "Three stars is the only rating that is adequate for the restaurant."
Later on, I heard that during the first year that Jiro's was checked by Michelin Jiro didn't make sushi for Michelin even once.
Yoshikazu was the one who made sushi for them.
I want both of my sons to continue on.
They both will run their own restaurants.
I will admit I trained my sons more strictly than the other apprentices.
But I did so for the sake of their futures, not because I wanted to be mean to them.
It's something that I thought about from the beginning.
Even if I were to be gone right now, I know they can go on.
Yoshikazu just needs to keep it up for the rest of his life.
That's what is most important.
He should just keep doing the same thing for the rest of his life.
Always... look beyond and above yourself.
Always try... to improve on yourself.
Always strive to elevate your craft.
That's what he taught me.
Okay, are there any changes to the schedule?
Arnie？ Line item 7, which is shown for all day, all of first shift Tuesday.
The tank pressurization test will not start until 13:00.
When do you want to run the leak check?
First shift Tuesday.
Arnie, you gonna extend that time out for five hours by cutting it off in the front end of that... LH2 storage tank pressurization?
Negative.
Its 3 hours and 32 minutes until man begins the greatest adventure in his history.
If all goes well, Apollo 11 astronauts Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins are to lift off from Pad 39A out there on the voyage man always has dreamed about.
So it is now, before they go, as their gleaming vehicle sits poised and peaceful out there, that there is time--if only briefly in this busy morning-- to think of those three men,and the burdens and the hopes that they carry on behalf of all mankind.
And boring through the vastness, the blackness and the cold of space they'll carry the pledge made eight years ago by President Kennedy.
To put a man on the moon and bring him back safely in this decade.
Each segment of the mission, every individual piece, has to be completed perfectly in order for the next step to be possible.
And of course the nation itself is backing us so we just sincerely hope that we measure up to that.
The whole Apollo program was designed to get two Americans to the lunar surface and back again to Earth safely.
The enormity of this event is something that only history will be able to judge.
Apollo 11 has very simply been given the mission of carrying men to the moon, landing them there, and bringing them safely back.
For in addition to the mission the three astronauts will perform, and the experiments they'll undertake, these men will carry with them many other things, many things that are not nearly so easy to describe.
During the planned Apollo 11 journey, we'll be concerned with such things as mid-course corrections and dockings.
The astronauts of course will be concerned with very much more.
The flight of Apollo 11 is to be the culmination of a national effort and the most difficult, most dangerous mission ever attempted since this country, and the Russians, started sending men into space.
38-year-old civilian Neil Alden Armstrong is to become the first human being to touch the moon.
Aidrin will follow just 20 minutes later, but Armstrong will take that first step.
The mission of Apollo 11, a journey certainly for the history books, a beginning of mans greatest adventure, leaving this planet to set foot on the moon.

This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.
T minus three hours, four minutes, 32 seconds and counting.
Right on time as far as the astronaut countdown is concerned, the prime crew now departing from their crew quarters here at the Kennedy Space Center.
Astronauts Neil Armstrongand, Edwin Aldrin then finally Mike Collins, plus their suit technicians and director of flight crew operations Deke Slayton now boarding the transfer van for the trip to the launch pad.
The trip in the transfer van should take some 15 minutes or so to reach the pad, at which time the astronauts will board the first of two elevators for the trip to the 320 foot level at the launch pad, where they will then proceed to ingress the spacecraft.
We logged the departure from the building at about 6:27 a.M. Eastern Daylight Time.
The transfer van now departing from the Manned Spacecraft Operations Building at the Kennedy Space Center on the start of its eight mile trip to Launch Pad A here at complex 39 where the Saturn V launch vehicle now fully loaded with propellants, going through preliminary checkouts.
This is launch control.
Pat, 10,000 odd cars, we estimated, were parked around the gate I area at 4 a.M. when we got here.
Cars every space here.
Little kids staring wide-eyed at the Saturn V glowing in the huge neon spotlight 15 miles away.
And we saw teenagers with telescopes.
It was the very same road we came over eight long years ago, 21 manned space flights ago.
We came out at just about the same hour to cover Alan Shepards.
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control.
T minus 2 hours, 45 minutes, 55 seconds and counting.
As the prime crew for Apollo 11, astronauts Neil Armstrong,Mike Collins and Edwin Aldrin are on the terminal part of their trip to the launch pad, in the transfer van, its now making the curve toward the pad.
We have discovered a problem at the launch pad itself as the crew is about to arrive We have a leak in a valve located in a system associated with replenishing liquid hydrogen for the third stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle.
We have sent a team of three technicians and a safety man to the pad and these technicians these technicians are now tightening bolts around the valve.
CLTC, this is CLTS.
Go ahead.
We have a leak on the S-IVB N Valve.
We have it in the override closed position to see if it'll get better.
It seems to be getting worse.
Roger, which camera is that available on?
Its on camera 18.
Camera 18, you can see the men working on the hydrogen leak.
Once the technicians depart we will send hydrogen again through this system to assure that the leak has been corrected.
The astronauts now coming up toward the pad itself as the crew of several technicians at the 200 foot level proceed to tighten some bolts around a leaking valve.
The astronaut team which has just arrived at the pad, the transfer van now backing up toward the elevator.
In a matter of 5 minutes or so, we'll be ready for the spacecraft commander Neil Armstrong to come across the sill at the 320 foot level.
That is our status at 2 hours, 43 minutes, 47 seconds and counting.
This is Launch Control.
MSTC, CBTS 111.

Okay.
This is Apollo Saturn Launch Control, weve just passed the two hour 21 minute mark in our countdown and we are proceeding at this time.
At the 320 foot level, all three astronauts now aboard the spacecraft.
Just a few minutes ago, astronaut Buzz Aidrin came in and took the center seat to join Neil Armstrong on the left and Mike Collins on the right.
These are the positions they will fly at liftoff.
120 feet down, the work continues on a leaky valve at the 200 foot level, the technicians still hard at work tightening bolts around that valve at this time.
CDR, STC.
How do you read?
STC, loud and clear.
Good morning, Neil.
Good morning.
Welcome aboard.
CMP, STC. How do you read?
STC, CMP. Loud and clear.
Good morning, Buzz.
Good morning. How are you gentlemen?
Just fine, thank you.
Let me make a last check here.
CDR, LMP and CMP, are you ready for hatch close?
Any adjustment on your straps?
LMPs happy.
Roger. Okay, good luck.
Thank you, Günter.
See you around, Günter.
All right, pad leader, let's proceed.
Roger, we're proceeding with closing the hatch.
Roger. Sequence 441, the CM hatch is closed.
Roger.
The hatch is closed and we're beginning to purge the cabin to bring it to the proper atmosphere for launch, which is a combination of oxygen and nitrogen, 60%oxygen and 40% nitrogen atmosphere.
Of course the astronauts themselves are breathing pure oxygen through their space suits.
Coming up shortly will be another key test in which both the launch crew for the launch vehicle crew and the spacecraft team combine together with commander Neil Armstrong to make a thorough check of the emergency detection system.
This is the system that will signal the astronauts in the cabin if anything goes wrong below them.
We used a ground based computer to accomplish this test.
It will take some 30 minutes.
Neil Armstrong will be doing most of the work in the spacecraft, responding as different cue lights signify different difficulties presented to him.
Our countdown continuing, this is Kennedy Launch Control.
NASA officials. 5,000 guests in all, including 400 congressmen and members of the Supreme Court, the Presidential Cabinet.
The NASA official who escorted us over to this site today has called it a Roman circus.
We all know that NASA has an agreement with over 60 countries... T minus 61 minutes on the Apollo 11 countdown and all elements are go at this time.
Here in the firing room, the launch vehicle test team still keeping a close eye on the status of the propellants aboard the Saturn V launch vehicle.
This problem with the leaking valve is no problem at this time.
We've actually bypassed the valve, but we are maintaing our hydrogen supply aboard the vehicle.
That big swing arm that has been attached to the spacecraft up to now will be moved back now.
In 5 seconds, the swing arm will come back.
Mark.
CBTS, this is CSA 9, arm 9 is retracted.
CBTS copy.
Countdown still proceeding satisfactorily at this time.
T minus 30 minutes, 52 seconds and counting; aiming toward our planned lift off time of 32 minutes past the hour the start of our launch window, some final checks of the destruct system of the three stages of the Saturn V launch vehicle.
In the event, during powered flight that the vehicle strayed rather violently off course, the range safety officer could take action to destroy the vehicle, which obviously would occur after the astronauts were separated by their escape tower from the faulty vehicle.
We've just got by an important test with the launch vehicle, checking out the various batteries in the three stages and Instrument Unit of the Saturn V.
We remain on external power through most of the count to preserve those batteries which must be used during the powered flight.
W&ve just taken a look at them by going internal and then switching back to external again.
The batteries all look good.
The next time we go internal will be at the 50 second mark with those batteries and they will remain, of course, on internal power during the flight.
14 minutes, 30 seconds and counting.
All still going well with the countdown at this time.
For status report, well now switch to Mission Control Houston.

You'll be AOS at Goldstone at 1:29:02, LOS at Goldstone, 1:33:55, over.
Roger.
This is Apollo Control at 1 hour 51 minutes.
Moving across the Atlantic now towards Africa.
And on the next revolution, the spacecraft will be accelerating to the required speed to get it into an orbit that'll intercept the moon during the trans-lunar injection maneuver, the burn with the Saturn third stage that will place the spacecraft on its trajectory toward the moon.
Go/No Go for TLI.
-GUIDANCE. -go, flight.
-GNC. -We're go, Flight.
- EECOM.  - We're go, Flight.
-FIDO. -We're go, Flight.
-RETRO. -Go, Flight.
- Ok, CAPCOM. - Apollo 11, this is Houston, you are go for TLI. Over.
Apollo 11, thank you.
We just got telemetry back on here, BOOSTER, and everything is go.
Roger, everything looks good here.
We're showing present altitude about 108 nautical miles.
We expect to be at an altitude of 177 nautical miles at cutoff.
Were just coming in to the terminator here.
Ignition.
We have ignition, Flight.
Roger.
We're go.
Thrust is go.
We confirm ignition and the thrust is go.
GUIDANCE initiate.
Roger.
FIDO, radar confirms ignition.
Trajectory and guidance look good and the stage is good, over.
Roger, Apollo 11 is go.
Telemetry and radar tracking are both solid.
-Cut-off. - Roger.
We show cut-off and we copy the numbers on noun 62.
Houston, Apollo 11, that Saturn gave us a magnificent ride.
Roger, 11, it certainly looks like you're well on your way now.
That was Neil Armstrong praising the launch vehicle.
We finally got some radar data back.
Looks good.
We had a good burn we've got a good flight to the moon coming up.
Roger.
FLIGHT CAPCOM, you want me to pass up those times?
- That's affirm. - Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston.
For your information, we expect the maneuver to separation attitude to begin at 3 pIus 05 pIus 03.
The crew at this time pressing ahead with their transposition and docking maneuver.
The spacecraft, after having separated the Saturn third stage, turning around, docking with the lunar module, extracting the lunar module from the Saturn third stage, and pushing ahead en route to the moon.
A little bit to our right.
Okay, I see him.
We need about 5-degree right, we need to stop our... He's pretty far away.
How long do we want to run this film?
How does he look, Mike?
Okay, you got a 100 and  44 Its a very weak signal.
We believe that Mike Collins is now maneuvering the spacecraft.
The antenna patterns arent too good at the moment.
Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind, request Omni Bravo if you read us. Out.
The whole LM quivers every so often.
The whole surface of it, you know, shakes like that.
- Really? - Just in one spot; its not being hit... Standby, we're close.
Houston, Apollo 11, all 12 latches are locked.
Buzz Aidrin reporting that all 12 of the latches in the docking mechanism have locked.
Houston, we're ready for LM ejection.
We are sepd, we have a cryo press light.
Houston, Apollo 11, we've completed our maneuver.
Houston, roger out.
This is Apollo Control at 6 hours, 16 minutes into the mission.
Velocity now 11,479 feet per second.
Apollo 11s distance from Earth, 27,938 nautical miles.
CAPCOM is now Charlie Duke and Gene Kranz and his white team of flight controllers is preparing to take over the responsibility from Cliff Charlesworths team.
The PTC has started now,it looks good to us, and we'II be ready to copy in a minute or two.
Roger, Mike, we see it increasing now.
The spacecraft will be placed in the passive thermal control mode, will be rotated about its X-axis at a rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain proper temperature balance within the spacecraft.
Houston, you might be interested that out my left hand window right now, right now,I can observe the entire continent of North America, down to the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, and then I run out of window.
I didnt know what I was looking at, but I sure did like it.
Okay.
I didnt have much outside my window.
Apollo 11, Houston.
We'd like a crew status report.
We're about to tell you goodnight, over.
Status report is as follows:
Radiation-CDR 1102, Cmp 10002, Lmp 09003, Negative medications, fit as a fiddle, over.
Copy 11, thank you much.
You're cleared for some Zs, over.
Okay, maybe we'll get around to lunch.
Morning, Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger, Apollo 11, good morning.
Goldstone reports they're receiving TV from the spacecraft.
Calling in from about 130,000 miles out.
Hello there, sports fans, you got a little bit of me, plus Neils on the center couch and Buzz is doing the camera work.
And NeiIs standing on his head again, he's trying to make me nervous.
Roger, copy, and we see the DSKY flashing with a 651.
We do have a happy home, there's plenty of room for the three of us.
Apollo 11 is presently 131,000 nautical miles from Earth.
The spacecraft slowly rotates to maintain thermal balance.
It looks like we got a good PTC going.
lts good night from the white team, over.
Okay, see you tomorrow, thank you for everything.
Good morning, Apollo 11.
Good morning, Houston. Apollo 11.
l've got the world in my window for a change.
Sounds like one of these rotating restaurants.
Okay, all flight controllers, lets get handed over pretty quickly to the white team here.
Were going to be crawling into the LM shortly, we're terminating PTC.
Flight Network, were receiving live TV.
Interior view of the command module looking up into the LM hatch area.
Okay, it's moved now, coming down.
Yeah, we're about to open the hatch now.
Buzz Aidrin has apparently carried the camera into the LM with him.
The vehicle is surprisingly very clean.
Just a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags, and now behind we have the DSKY and the ACA.
That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent down the ladder.
It will be taking one frame a second.
Hello there, earthlings.
Hello there.
Probably the most unusual position a cameramans ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking a picture upside down.
Were going to go ahead and take all the loose data on back into the command module, Charlie.
Roger.
And were going to turn our TV monitor off now while we have some other work to do, Apollo 11, signing off.
Apollo 11, Houston.
As the sun sinks slowly in the west, the white team bids you good night.
You earned your pay today, Charlie.
Roger.
All right, goodnight all.
the government has succeeded in harnessing the resources of the government, the scientific community, the universities... Now Iets take a few minutes to review what else has been going on around the world while Apollo 11 has held our attention.
The lull in the ground fighting in Vietnam is now in its fifth week with only one incident reported from the battle field so far today, and that one described as minor.
Police Chief Dominick Arena, who filed a formal complaint charging Senator Edward Kennedy with leaving the scene of the accident that took the life of Mary Jo Kopechne, a passenger in the senators car.
Kennedy, who suffered a slight concussion in the accident remains in seclusion near the family compound at Hyannis Port.
Go ahead.
You hear about that story about Ted Kennedy?
Did yaII hear about that?
That was the biggest story on the news.
Yeah, yeah, theyd forgotten about Apollo for Ted Kennedy.
Gnc, this is CAPCOM on mocr 1.
Go ahead.
Have your people plotted pressure in that bottle versus time, so we could take a look at it?
I dont think they've got it yet, they're testing work, CAPCOM.
Okay, how about giving me a call when that comes up, we'd like to take a look at it on one of the screens.
Rog.
Morning again, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger, 11, good morning.
Your systems are looking good from down here.
Yeah, looks good up here too, Bruce.
Deke Slayton, director of flight crew operations and two members of the backup crew, Bill Anders, Jim Lovell have joined Bruce McCandless at the CAPCOM console.
Apollo 11, this is Houston, over.
Roger, go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 11.
11, this is Houston.
If Mike has a mask, hes lost respiration rates on the biomed telemetry.
Well, he was shaving a little bit ago.
He might have... Okay, Mike, we had a request that you check the two electrodes that are placed one on each side of your lower rib cage, over.
All those wires and things look normal up here.
Roger, Mike, we can see variations on our trace as you connected and disconnected, but the medics still dont have a signal.
I promise to let you know if I stop breathing.
Coming up in less than 10 seconds now, will be crossing into the sphere of influence of the moon at this point as the moons gravitational force becomes the dominant effect on the spacecraft trajectory and our displays will shift from Earth reference to moon reference.
The spacecraft was at a distance of 186,437 nautical miles from Earth and 33,822 nautical miles from the moon.
All spacecraft systems are functioning normally, the mission going very smoothly.
View of the moon that we've been havings really spectacular.
The sun right behind the edge of the moon now.
The solar corona.
The sky is lit all the way around the moon, quite an eerie sight.
There's a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the suns corona coming from behind the moon the way it is.
Its a view worth the price of the trip.
Mother Earth is 206,059 nautical miles behind.
Coming up on the lunar orbit insertion burn, in which the spacecraft will start its initial orbit around the moon.
The maneuver will slow the spacecraft down considerably from its present velocity.
And it should come from behind the east face of the moon 33 minutes later.
Yeah, the moon is there, boy, in all its splendor.
Hello, moon, hows your old backside?
All your systems are looking good, going around the corner. We'll see you on the other side, over.
Loss of signal as Apollo 11 goes behind the moon.
Servo power to Ad.
-2 to AC 2.   -2 to AC 2.
Translational control power on.
TransIationaI control power is on.
Hand controller number 2 armed.
Signal hand controller number 2 is armed.
99.
Proceed.
Got B mode.
Burning, were looking good.
-A. -Here comes B--B, I mean, thrust A mark.
Got them both?
Okay, now whats your chamber pressure?
Its good. Its 95.
Plugs is oscillating around.
Okay, ball valves closed, barber poles.
That was a beautiful burn.
God damn, I guess.
170 by 60.
Like gangbusters!
30 seconds from acquisition time.
Well, I have to vote with the 10 crew, that thing is brown.
Sure is.
Looks tan to me.
But when I first saw it at that other sun angle, it really looked gray.
The more sun angle you get... More brown with increasing sun angle.
God, thats a big beauty.
Gigantic crater, look at the mountain going around it.
My gosh, they're monsters.
That is a big mother over here, too.
-Whoo! Get another picture of that big fella.   -Yeah.
Look at those craters in a row.
You see them right-- going right out there?
There it is, its coming up!
-What?   -The Earth.
-See it?   -Yeah.
Beautiful!
Right over the LM.
Boy, does that ever look beautiful in the sextant.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston, do you read?
Yeah, we sure do, Houston.
LOl I burn just nominal as all get out and everything looking good!
It was like perfect.
Delta-Tig zero, burn time 5:57, 60.9 by 169.9.
That burn report was by Neil Armstrong.
Roger, we copy you.
The spacecraft is looking good to us on telemetry.
Apollo 11 on its first lunar revolution.
You got a good view there, Neil?
Yeah, I sure do.
Boy, it's beautiful out there, isn't it?
Man, this is really something, you ought to look at this, you want to watch our approach into the landing site, you got to watch it right through this window.
Were coming over-we just passed Mount Marilyn, were coming up on the Maskelyne series here, straight out ahead.
80 hours, 48 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11.
Astronaut Charles Duke has arrived on the scene.
Hey, Dave?   -Yeah?
What put us four minutes ahead?
We arrived at the moon four minutes early.
Speaks well for the booster.
Well, no sh... 11, that really winds things up as far as were concerned on the ground for the evening.
We're ready to go to bed and get a little sleep, over.
Yeah, were about to join you.
Rog.
This is of course the great day for mankind when we leave our Planet Earth and set foot on the moon.
So on this historic day Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are in their lunar module, in their spacesuits.
On this next pass, they are preparing to undock.
Both spacecraft looking very good at this time.
The following revolution, revolution 13, Armstrong and Aldrin they will undock from the Command and Service Module, from which point the powered descent to the lunar surface will be initiated.
APOLLO 11, Houston, we are go for undocking, over.
Roger, understand.
We're all set when you are, Mike.
Okay, here you go.
See ya.
Looks like a good Sep.
The Eagles undocked.
The Eagle has wings.
Looking good.
Testing.
There you go, one minute till Tig.
You guys take care.
See you later.
Okay, all flight controllers.

Okay, rate of descent is looking good.
Eagle, Houston, everything looking good.over Roger, copy.
Houston, were getting a little fluctuation in the AC voltage now.
Roger.
It's okay, Flight. Stand by.
It's okay. Looking good to us.
Youre still looking good at coming up on three minutes.
Okay, we went by the three-minute point early.
We're long.
Our position checks downrange show us to be a little long.
Roger, copy.
He thinks youre a little bit long downrange.
Thats right. I think we confirmed that.
We confirmed that. Rog.
Altitude rate looks right down the groove.
Roger, about three seconds long.
Rolling over.
Okay, all flight controllers, I'm going around the horn.
Okay, now watch that signal strength.
Make your Go/No Go based on the data you had prior to LOS.
I see we got it back. Give you another few seconds.
We're yawing, Flight.

The ED Batts are go at four minutes.
Did you get that, TELCOM? ED Batts are go.
You are go to continue powered descent, you are go to continue powered descent.
And Eagle, Houston. We had data dropout.
You're still looking good.
Looks good, Flight, looks good.
Houston, youre looking at our Delta H.
Program alert.
lts a 1202.
1202.
1202 alarm.
1202. Whats that?
1202 alarm.
Its executive overflow, if it does not occur again, were fine.
It has not occurred again.
Okay, were go, continue.
Give us a reading on the 1202 program alarm.
We're go.
Roger, we got you, we're go on that alarm.
Roger.
Same alarm and it appears to come up when we have a 16168 up.
6 plus 25. Throttle down. 6 plus 25. Throttle down.
Throttle down on time.
You can feel it in here when it throttles down.

Program alarm.
1201. 1201.
1201 alarm. Same type, we're go, Flight.
We're go.
Pretty rocky area.
Attitude hold.
Okay, at hold.
100 feet, three and a half down.
Think we better be quiet, Flight.
Rog.
Okay, the only call-outs from now on will be fuel.
Stand by for 60.
60. 60 seconds.
60 seconds.
Lights on.
60 feet down, two and a half.
Okay, 55 feet.
Okay, looks like a good area here.
Its looking good, down a half.
Two forward, forward.

The arm is off.
We copy you down, Eagle.
Houston, Tranquility base here.
The Eagle has landed.
Roger, Tranquility.
We copy you on the ground.
You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.
We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Very smooth touchdown.
Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase.
The auto targeting was taking us right into a football field sized crater, and it required us flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.
Roger, we copy. It was beautiful from here.
Be advised there are lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world.
Over.
We have some heart rates for Neil Armstrong during that powered descent to the lunar surface.
At the time the burn was initiated, Armstrong's heart rate was 110.
At touchdown on the lunar surface he had a heart rate of 156, and the heart rate is now in the 90s.
We do not have biomedical data on Buzz AIdrin.
The hatch is coming open.
Hatch reported coming open at 109 hours, 8 minutes, 5 seconds.
Okay, Houston, I'm on the porch.
Roger, Neil.
Okay, everythings nice and straight in here.
Okay, can you pull the door open a little more?
Houston, this is Neil, radio check.
Neil, this is Houston, loud and clear.
Break, break. Buzz, this is Houston.
Radio check and verify TV circuit breaker in.
Roger, TV circuit breakers in.
And read you loud and clear.
Roger.
And were getting a picture on the TV.
You got a good picture, huh?
There's a great deal of contrast in it and currently its upside down in our monitor but we can make out a fair amount of detail.
Okay.
Im at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about one or two inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained as you get close to it, its almost like a powder.
Ground mass is very fine.
Okay, Im going to step off the LM now.
Thats one small step for man.
One giant leap for mankind.
I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.
Neil, this is Houston, we're copying.
There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected.
Its even perhaps easier than the simulations of 1/6th G that we performed in various simulations on the ground.
Descent engine did not leave a crater of any size, it has about one foot clearance on the ground.
I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.
Roger, Neil, were reading you loud and clear.
We see you're getting some pictures and the contingency sample.
Its interesting. Its a very soft surface but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector I run into very hard surface but it appears to be a very cohesive material of the same sort.
III try to get a rock in here.
That looks beautiful from here, Neil.
It has a stark beauty all its own.
lts like much of the high desert of the United States.
Its different, but its very pretty out here.
That in the pocket?
Ah, yeah, push down.
Got it?
No, its not all the way in. Push it.
There you go.
Contingency sample is in the pocket.
My oxygen is 81%.
I have no flags and Im in minimum flow.
Okay, I got the camera going at one frame a second.
Ready for me to come out?
Yeah, just stand by a second, I'll move this over the handrail.
How far are my feet from the... Okay, youre right at the edge of the porch.
Okay, now I want to back up and partially close the hatch... making sure not to lock it on my way out.
Particularly good thought.
That's our home for the next couple hours.
We want to take good care of it.
Youve got three more steps, and then a long one.
Beautiful view.
lsn't that something?
Magnificent sight out here.
Magnificent desolation.
Okay, Houston, Im going to change lenses on you.
Roger, Neil.
Were getting a new picture, you can tell its a longer focal length lens.
For those who haven't read the plaque, well read the plaque thats on the front landing gear of this LM:
Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon. July 1969 A.D.
We came in peace for all mankind.
Neil Armstrong getting ready to move the TV camera now out to its panorama position.
I got plenty of cable.
You got plenty, plenty more.
Okay, that looks good there, Neil.
Okay.
One hour, seven minutes time expended.
Buzz is erecting the solar wind experiment now.
Some of these small depressions... through the upper surface of the soil and about five or six inches of bay breaks loose and moves as if it were caked on the surface when in fact it really isn't.
Houston, Columbia on high gain, over.
Columbia, this is Houston, reading you loud and clear, over.
Yeah, reading you loud and clear. Hows it going?
Roger, the EVA is progressing beautifully.
They're setting up the flag now.
Great.
I guess youre about the only person around that doesnt have TV coverage of the scene.
How is the quality of the TV?
Oh, its beautiful, Mike, it really is.
They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes from the lunar surface.
Beautiful, just beautiful.
Ah, Neil and Buzz.
The President of the United States is in his Office now and would like to say a few words to you, over.
That would be an honor.
Go ahead, Mr. President.
This is Houston out.
Hello, Neil and Buzz.
Im talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House.
And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House.
I just cant tell you how proud we all are of what you have done.
For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.
And for people all over the world,because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.
For one priceless moment, in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one.
One in their pride in what you have done; and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Its a great honor and privilege for us to be here, representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, men with interests and a curiosity and with the vision for the future.
Its an honor for us to be able to participate here today.
NeiIs been on the surface an hour now, Buzz not quite, 20 minutes less than that.
Heart rates on both crewmen averaging between 90 and 100.
I dont note any abnormalities in the LM.
Quads seem to be in good shape, the primary and secondary struts are in good shape, antennas are all in place, theres no evidence of a problem underneath.
The SEQ bay contains the scientific experiments to be left on the surface of the moon.
Have you got us a good area picked out?
Buzz Aidrin carrying the two experiments.
Straight out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.
Im going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.
The laser reflector is installed, and the bubbles level and the alignment appears to be good.
They've been on their life support systems 2 hours and 25 minutes.
Houston, I have the seismic experiment flipped over now and Im aligning it with the sun and all parts of the solar array are clear of the ground now.
Buzz Aldrin is collecting a core tube sample.
It almost looks wet.
Got it! Sampled.
Neil, this is Houston.
After youve got the core tubes and the solar wind, anything else that you can throw into the box would be acceptable.
Houston, we've got about I'd say 20 pounds of carefully selected, if not documented, samples.
Houston, roger, well done, out.
Anything more before I head on up, Bruce?
Negative, head on up the ladder, Buzz.
Adios, amigos.
Transferring the sample containers into the LM cabin now.
Unofficial time off the surface at 111:37:32.
Okay, the hatch is closed and latched and verified secure.
Okay.
And we'd like to say from all of us down here in Houston and really from all of us in all the countries in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today.
Over.
Thank you very much.
It's been a long day.
Yes indeed, get some rest there, and have at it tomorrow.
Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins is experiencing during the 47 minutes of each lunar revolution when he's behind the moon, while he waits for his comrades to soar with Eagle from Tranquility Base, and rejoin him for the trip back to earth.
Collins, with the help of flight controllers here in Mission Control Center, has kept the Command Module systems going pocketa pocketa pocketa.
Columbia, Columbia, good morning from Houston.
Hows the black team today?
All primed and rarin to go?
Ah, you betcha there, Mike.
Going to keep you a little busy here soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52, option 3.
And then when you come on around the other side there, well give you some landmark tracking information on 130.
All right, fine, understand. Thank you.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
How was the resting standing up there?
Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?
Ah, roger.
Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waist tether and hes been lying on the ascent engine cover and I curled up on the floor. Over.
Ah, roger. Copy, Buzz.
Our science support room here in Mission Control Center reports receiving continuous data from the passive seismic experiment placed on the lunar surface last night by the Apollo 11 crew... recorded the astronauts footsteps on the moon and will probably receive its strongest signal when the ascent engine ignites and starts Eagle on its way into lunar orbit and rendezvous with Columbia.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Go ahead.
roger. Just a reminder here, we want to make sure you leave the rendezvous radar circuit breakers pulled.
Okay.
Eagle and Columbia, this is the backup crew.
Congratulations on yesterdays performance and our prayers are with you for the rendezvous, over.
Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Jim.
Almost 5,000 pounds of propellant will be run through the ascent engine on the ascent burn which will place Eagle back into lunar orbit and following that, the rendezvous sequence consummate, completed with the docking at 128 hours approximately.
Flight Operations Director, Chris Kraft, commented that some 500 million people around the world were helping push Eagle off the moon and back into orbit.
Flight director Glynn Lunney is polling the various positions here in the control room on their readiness.
FIDO, status.
Got it all, Flight, good to go.
-GUIDANCE. -Waiting for GUIDANCE steering at two minutes.
-CONTROL. -We're go, Flight.
- TELCOM.  - Go. Flight.
- Surgeon.  - Go, Flight.
We see it, Flight. Looks good.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Roger, go ahead.
Roger, Eagle's looking real fine to us down here.
And you're clear for takeoff.
Roger, understand.
We're number one on the runway.
GUIDANCE reports both navigation systems on Eagle are looking good.
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, abort stage, engine arm, ascent, proceed.
The Eagle has wings. Stand by for pitchover.
Pitching over.
Very smooth.
We're going right down U.S. 1.
Roger.
Not very much thruster activity.
FLIGHT, FIDO, PGNS MSFN, we're looking good.
Okay, mighty fine. Go, both systems.
30 seconds, Flight.
700, 150 up. Beautiful.
- TELCOM.  - Go.
Eagle, Houston, you're still looking mighty fine.
Roger, good agreement in Delta-V to go in both AGS and PGNS.
Roger.
All three data sources are agreeing quite closely here.
Eagle, Houston.
Aft Omni, low-bit rate, and we'll see you at 127 plus 51.
127 hours, 39 minutes, 39.2 seconds.
This is the start time for a series of velocity match maneuvers to bring Eagle in with Columbia.
Uh, Houston, the AGS has a Delta-H of 15.5 and a maneuver of 51.3.
Roger, we copy.
As the two vehicles come around on the 26th lunar revolution, Mike Collins aboard Columbia is spring loaded to do what is called a mirror image maneuver.
Okay, we're about seven feet a second coming in at you.
Eagle, Columbia.
I've got 470 now for R-dot, and I just broke lock.
Could you hold silence for a few seconds here while I reacquire?
Columbia has reacquired you.
Okay, Mike, I'll try to get in position here and then you got it.
Eagle, Columbias starting to maneuver to TPI attitude.
Okay.
Okay, I got it from here.
Looks good, Mike.
okay.
Okay, we're all yours, Columbia.
Communications are somewhat scratchy.
Columbia and Eagle now reunited to become Apollo 11 again.
Apollo 11, Houston, about a minute and a half to LOS, you're looking great.
lts been a mighty fine day.
Boy, you're not kidding.
Armstrong and Aidrin transferring back to the Command Module with Mike Collins.
Houston, this is Columbia reading you loud and clear.
We're all three back inside, the hatch is installed, were running a pressure check-leak check.
Everything is going well.
Roger. How is it feel up there to have some company?
Damn good, I'II tell ya.
I bet.
I bet youd almost be talking to yourself up there after 10 revs or so.
Ah, no. Its a happy home up here, it'd be nice to have 100 million Americans up here.
Roger.
They were with you in spirit anyway, at least that many.
Thank you, sir.
And Apollo 11, Houston.
All your systems look real good to us.
We would like you to jettison Eagle.
You're go for power arm and you're go for jettison.
Okay.
There she goes. She was a good one.
Roger dodger.
We got Eagle looking good.
lt's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about two feet per second from that jettison.
The crew jettisoned the LM at 130 hours 30 minutes.
We're now 10 seconds away from Trans-Earth Injection.
They will burn their service propulsion system engine for 2 minutes, 28 seconds, to start them on their way back to earth.
Apollo 11, Houston.
one minute to LOS.
The trans-earth injection maneuver will be performed on backside of the moon at the beginning of the 31st revolution.
We'll reacquire the spacecraft on the other side of the moon.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston.
You're looking good going over the hill.
Go sic em!
Thank you, sir. We'll do it.
Standby for ullage.
Ullage.
Copy.
Burn!
A good one. Nice.
I got two balls. Okay, here come the other two.
...barber pole, gray, the other two are on good.
Man, that feels like G, doesnt it?
One minute.
Chamber pressures holding right on 100.
Gimbals look good.
Total attitude looks good.
Rates are damped out a little bit.
Standing by for engine off.
It should be shut down now.
Okay.
Shutdown.
Beautiful.
Beautiful burn.
SPS, I love you!
You are a jewel!
Aos.
And theres the cue, we have acquisition of signal.
Halleluiah!
Thank you, Charlie boy.
Looking good here.
That was a beautiful burn.
- They dont come any finer.  - Rog.
Tell them to open up the LRL doors, Charlie.
Roger, we got you coming home.
Lets get some music... how about these tapes?
Hey, this should be getting larger.
And if it is, its the place were coming home to.
No matter where you travel, its always nice to get home.
We concur, 11...weII be happy to have you back.
Apollo 11 now 94,961 nautical miles from Earth.
Re-entry is scheduled to begin 18 hours, 18 minutes and 12 seconds.
How's old Flight, Bruce?
Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee while we were over on the backside?
Things have been going pretty smoothly down here.
He's really not that hard to get along with.
Ah, he must be mellowing.
Well, we've only got two of them back here right now.
The next item scheduled on the flight plan is a television transmission.
You may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children, and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aidrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.
Oh, we're glad to hear that.
You have good S-band signal strength now, Houston?
Okay, you're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch.
This has been far more than three men on a voyage to the moon.
We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown.
This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine.
All you see is the three of us.
But beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others.
Wed like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built this spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts.
To those people, tonight we give a special thank you.
And to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you.
Goodnight from Apollo 11.
Weather in the recovery area:
Skies will be partly cloudy, six-foot sea, temperature near 80 degrees.
This landing area is 215 miles to the northeast from the original landing area, it moved because of thundershowers in the original area.
Apollo 11's distance now is 3,000 nautical miles, velocity 26,685 feet per second.
In the next 20 minutes, Apollo 11 will add almost 10,000 feet per second to that figure.
Entry at 75 statute miles.
Beginning blackout at 62 statute miles.
And main shoot deployment 10,500 feet.
And 11, Houston.
Weather's still holding real fine in the recovery area, looks like its about 1500 scattered, high scattered, and still three to six foot waves The air part of it sounds good.
Roger.
The Earth is really getting bigger up here and of course we see a crescent.
Apollo 11 lined up right down the middle of the entry corridor.
We're a minute and 45 seconds from entry.
Blackout will begin 18 seconds after entry.
Apollo 11, Houston.
You're still looking mighty fine here, youre cleared for landing.
Ah, we appreciate that Ron. Thank you.
Rog. Gears down and locked.
Roger.
Guidance officer reports the Command Module computer looks good and the guidance and navigation system is go.
And 11, Houston. Youre going over the hill there shortly, youre looking mighty fine to us.
See you later.
There's the horizon.
Got the horizon now.
And beginning of blackout approximately 17 seconds after entry interface into the atmosphere.
400,000 feet or approximately 85 miles above the Earth.
At blackout, we were showing velocity 36,237 feet per second.
Range to go to splash, 1510 nautical miles.
Redstone LOS blackout.
Roger, you have arrived... Apollo 11, Houston, through ARIA.
We're looking for your.
Apollo 11, Houston through ARIA.
Houston through ARIA 4.
Okay, CAPCOM, one last call here and we'll have to give up and let the recovery people have it.
Apollo 11, Houston through ARIA.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Hornet, Hornet, over.
This is Apollo 11, we read you loud and clear.
Our position, 1330 16915.
There they are!
The condition of crew, over.
The condition of crew is 4,000-3500 feet on the way down.
Latitude, longitude, 13,30; 169,15...over.
Hornet roger, copy out.
Hornet reports spacecraft right on target point.
Splashdown!
Hornet, splashdown.
Hornet copies.
This is SWIM 1, the Command Module is at stable 1.
Hornet roger.
Stable I now, stable I.
Our condition is all three excellent.
We're just fine, take your time.
That was Mike Collins reporting the crew is excellent.
Doing all right, third astronaut is in the net and on his way up.
Clear the Command Module.
Everybodys in the hatch and finally in the helicopter.
This is Recovery 1.
I have three astronauts aboard, switching power and frequency, power and frequency.
Recovery 1, Hornet.
Understand Big Swimmer has completed his decontamination of the Command Module.
The elevator will take Recovery I down to the hangar deck where the crew will enter the Mobile Quarantine facility.
This control center becoming jammed with people.
We've never seen this many people in the control center at one time before.
The Apollo 11 plaque has been hung in the Mission Control Center, a replica of the crew patch.
And the flags are waving and the cigars are being lit up, and clear across the big board in front is President John F. Kennedys message to Congress from May 1961.
Even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know what benefits await us.
But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food, and survival, on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to Earth, reentering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun, almost as hot as it is here today, and do all this, and do all this and do it right, and do it first, before this decade is out, then we must be bold.
Men's first trip to the moon, a magnificent eight-day voyage spanning time and space and history, ended today when three American explorers brought their small ship down safely in the Pacific.
Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aidrin, and Michael Collins landed their spacecraft southwest of Hawaii at ten minutes of one, Eastern time nine miles from the recovery ship and two miles off target.
After donning protective clothing, the three astronauts were airlifted to the carrier Hornet, and transferred to a special isolation chamber.
Theyll be quarantined 18 days while scientists determine if theyve brought back any dangerous lunar organisms.
Their flight climaxed centuries of dreaming and months and years of planning and training.
1d like to take this opportunity particularly to thank all those of you I see out there I see out there who are my gracious hosts here in the lunar receiving laboratory.
And I can't say that I would choose to spend a couple of weeks like that, but I'm very glad that we got the opportunity to complete the mission.
These are the only three people left.
This is Mr. Alex Steele,Mrs. Juliette Ashby, Mrs. Amy Winehouse.        Ah, my booby.
D'you want a lick of the lollipop?
Come on, have a lick.
No, I don't.        Have a lick. Come here.
Come and have a lick.
No one wants to lick your slobbery lollipop.
Lauren, just lick it.        Here's me.
It's my 14th... birthday evening and party.
(Amy): I was singing with a little jazz unit, the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, must've been about 16, and I just loved jazz.
Dinah Washington... Sarah Vaughan, Tony Bennett.
I learned to sing from listening to stuff like Monk, and a lot of soloists as well, rather than just listening to singers.
I learned from everything, really.
So singing has always been important to me, but I never thought, "I love singing, I'll be a singer."
I just thought, "I'm lucky there is something I can always do, if I want to.
I'm so lucky like that."
But I didn't think it would be a career choice.
What's the date?
Today?        24th.
Is it?        Yeah.
The what?        24th.
Of what?        January.
And, um, what day is it?
Saturday.        And what year is it?
Lunchtime.
I was a 19-year-old office junior for a promotions company owned by Simon Fuller.
I just started to try and kind of blag it myself as a talent scout.
I was definitely out of my depth.
(Amy): My friend Tyler is a singer.
He was with Nicky Shymansky and Tyler said, "My friend Amy sings jazz and she's great."
Nicky said to me,"Want some studio time?"
I said, "For what?" And he was like, "Well, if you'd write songs, we'd make a record, get a record deal."
I was, like, "What do you get out of it?"
Hello.
I look ugly.
Yeah, look at you. You look lovely.
Yeah, look at you. You look lovely.
I don't. My chin's massive.
Worried about your chin?        That's there forever.
Decide to record it?        Yeah.
Hello.
I'm just here... smoking a fag.
I just like to... Oh, I look so grim.
I look like a floating head. You know, I've got no hair.
I'm just on a black screen.
There's my hand. What's going on?
She said she's not sure about writing songs, but she's written a lot of poems.
She knew full well she'd been writing songs, but they were very personal songs.
(Amy): I wouldn't write anything unless it was directly personal to me, just 'cause I wouldn't be able to tell the story right because I wouldn't have done it.
Even though some of it is personal in a sad way, I'd never let it just be that.
I'll always put a punchline in the song.
Just try and be different with my lyrics.
Someone gave me a CD,two songs, and they weren't necessarily what you'd call hit songs, but they conveyed an emotion that just touched me.
When you have that as an artist, you usually have a story to tell behind it.
But it's a big leap of faith.
But it's a big leap of faith.
I think my boss even questioned the deal, because we were really committing to giving an unsigned artist close to 250,000 pounds.
We both knew we wanted to live with each other, we both knew we wanted to move out.
She had family issues and I had lots of things going on with my family, and we looked after each other.
It was amazing. We were young kids and we were best friends, in a flat on our own.
She loved it.
Juliette would sing, Amy would sing... And we just used to see each other all the time.
We used to go to so many gigs with Amy.
And when she first started doing her music, we were all so excited and proud of it.
Where are we, Amy?
We're in Brighton.        Yeah, but what are we in now?
Um, we're in, uh... What's-it Square, Regency Square, in a black cab.
In a white cab. A beautiful cab.
And Lauren's with us.        Ah!
D'you know what my favourite thing about Nicky is?
His legs.
(Nick) Aw.
Know what my other favourite thing is?
What?        Not your hair.
and then, all of a sudden, very unimportant.
And then make you feel so important again.
That was what she did. She liked to get people into a comfortable position and then shock them.
If I got my hair right, then what would that mean?
That would mean you were ready to marry me.
(Nick): Her first relationship was with an older guy called Chris.
She really got the hots for him. Madly in love with him.
She wrote a few songs about having the hots for him.
And then, eventually, she lost interest and... She always used to talk about it and started writing about that.
I think when I was growing up, the music that was in the pop charts or, you know, the music that was... that people were releasing at the time, I just thought, "This isn't music, this is watered down, or this is, you know, just crap, someone else has written it for you and you have to sing it."
It's very much the case with some music today.
I really started writing music just as... to challenge myself, to see what I could write or, you know, just because there was nothing else there that I could listen to at the time.
And having listened to jazz and, you know, great songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, it was very... I felt like I had nothing new that was coming out at the time that really represented me or the way I felt.
So I just started writing, really, my own stuff and from personal experience.
This is, um, I Heard Love is Blind.
I'll just clip, clip my hair I'll just clip, clip my hair out of the way, 'cause it's gonna get on my nerves.
I remember thinking, when she walked in, I remember thinking, when she walked in, she was this complete force of nature.
I thought, "Wow, there's something about you."
And I remember thinking, "Please be good."
I wrote this in Miami with a guy called Salaam and, um... and I'm really proud of it.        (Nick): She was 18 and she was a very classic North London Jewish girl.
A lot of attitude.
Quite shy, but something emanated from her.
She had a charisma.
When you looked at her lyrical capability and her melodic capability, she was a very old soul in a very young body.
And we did the deal very, very quickly.
Amy's album came out yesterday and how many has it sold so far?
A pretty staggering 800, actually.
That is at least I've emptied my bank account buying 600 of them.
I've emptied my bank account buying 600 of them.
That is, at least half my friends have bought the album.
Bastards. I'd better call the other half up today.
Snug in a rug.
She's going to get annoyed.
Amy?
Explain what your little hub is all about.
(Ian): Hello. Oh, you're coming.        (Amy): Sleeping!
(Nick): Just give us a smile, then we can turn the camera off.
Come on, just give us a quick one. A one-second flash.
How big do you think you're going to be?
I don't, at all, because, you know, my music is not on that scale. The music is not on that scale.
Sometimes I wish it was, but I don't think I'm gonna be at all famous.
I don't think I could handle it.
I'd probably go mad.
You know what I mean? I would go mad.
Where are we going?        We're going to Birmingham!
Why are we going to Birmingham?
We're going to Birmingham to sing songs.
Yeah?        And make merry.
Oh, that was sick! That was sick!
Get me, get me.        Nicky, that was beautiful.
What are your thoughts on how beautiful that was?
My turn, my turn!
Wait, let me get a really good shot.
Oh, what a shot.
Oh!
She don't even care.
Watch it... watch it go in there.
Got no light in here.
Don't get my spots in.
What spots?
I love you.        Do you know I'm zooming in?
You're zooming in on all my spots!
You're a fucking cunt.
Does my hair look okay like this?
Yeah, very good. It's lovely.
Do you promise?        I promise.
What song d'you think I should do first tonight?
Right, I think you should start off with… Ah, I love your little cap! It's so cute!
Um, I think you should start off with a song called... Oh, on camera. Okay. Okay.
Go, sister. Go get done.        Stop!
Could you please introduce yourself?
Yes. Hello. I'm Amy Winehouse.
I'm 20. I'm a jazz singer.
I've heard your record and it sounds very, uh, mature.
Is it all live? Also, not only the singing, but also the instruments?
Yeah, all the instrumentation is completely live.
I wouldn't have any fake horns on my record.
I think they put fake strings on Take the Box, but I wasn't a part of that.
I would never, ever have put strings on my record. Ever.
And this guy doing the mix of this song, he just... didn't even think about it.
Upset?        Yeah.
Oh, okay. Okay, okay.
Okay. Um... There wasn't a girl that had been gobby in the media There wasn't a girl that had been gobby in the media for a long time.
 经纪人 And she could be very cutting.
Especially if she got bored or felt misunderstood.
Especially if she got bored or felt misunderstood.
(woman): I dunno, it seems to me, though, that every woman who writes about, you know, kind of puts it down on a record doesn't do them any harm.
Look at Dido. I mean, she... she used that album to clean out her emotional closet.
Did she?        Yeah, it's all about the break-up of her relationship and, you know, kind of like surviving. Mm... And, uh, and not, not going... I mean, like the whole thing about not going down with the ship.
Yeah...        I mean, Dido's Dido, but, you know, I mean, uh... I think she's one of the most exciting and brilliantly talented vocalists to emerge in this country in many, many years.
to emerge in this country in many, many years.
It is Amy Winehouse.
Fantastic.
You're managed by the company who looks after S Club 7, used to look after the Spice Girls, Simon Fuller.
Have they tried to mould you in any way?
Asked you to do things, to change the way you look or speak or behave?
Um, yeah, one of them tried to mould me into a big triangle shape and I went, "No!"
No, I've got my own style.
I've got my own style and I wrote my own songs and, you know, if someone has so much of something already, there's very little you can... add.
Yeah. You know what I like about you, as well?
The way you sound so common.
Because I am common and it's like, you know, it's so refreshing to hear someone who isn't speaking like they've taken elocution lessons.
Yeah. They gave me elocution lessons, but they kind of... They didn't stick.        Off my back, yeah.
I realized early on, when Amy made her mind up, she made her mind up.
when Amy made her mind up, she made her mind up.
And I found it difficult to stand up to her.
She would say, "Oh, Mum, you're so soft with me.
"I can get away with murder.
You should be tougher, Mum."
Well, I just accepted it.
I wasn't strong enough to say to her, "Stop."
I met another woman when Amy was about 18 months old.
We worked together. We were having an affair.
But another eight or nine years were to pass before I left home.
I was a coward.
But I felt that Amy was over it pretty quick.
When I was a child, I was very cheerful and gentle.
Nervous and shy, very kind until the age of nine After my parents divorced, I felt like I could wear whatever I wanted.
You can talk dirty and put on makeup. It’s so cool.
Tattoos, body piercings, skipping school.
Always with my boyfriend.
My mother often comes home from get off work during lunch time I was lying in the house with my boyfriend.
When Amy was a teenager, 13 or 14, When Amy was a teenager, 13 or 14, she was being taken to the doctor's and she was on antidepressants.
I used to take Celts (antidepressants), but it just makes me stupid, stupid.
I didn't know what depression was at that time.
I just know that sometimes I feel weird and different.
I think this is a trait of a musician, so I write music.
You know, I'm not like some people whose lives are a mess.
Many people suffer from depression, can't find a way to vent my pain, you know?
Unlike me, they can find a guitar and play for an hour to relax.
Amy used to always say to me that that was her dream, really, to do those sorts of shows, to play in jazz clubs to small audiences.
She had one of the most pure relationships to music, such an emotional relationship to music.
Like she needed music as if it was a person, and that she would die for it.
Let me read this.
Oh, my God.
Uh, and the winner... and the song is Stronger Than Me by Amy Winehouse and Salaam Remi.
Let's give it up!
This is me, isn't it? Right here.
Wow!
I don't believe this. Um, thank you, Salaam.
There's no picture of him, but Salaam is the most inspirational producer I've ever worked with.
And he has that unique skill of not just having the most appropriate beat, but also, um, drawing the artistry out.
And I guess that's the story of this song.
And I wanna thank...        What I allowed her to do was to really just put her wit into her songs.
When I heard her sing in front of me, When I heard her sing in front of me, I could tell she was really like a jazz singer.
She had the stylings of a 65-year-old jazz singer who knew the ropes up and down.
It was, like, "Okay, if this is what you are when you're 18, then what are gonna be when you're 25?"
We're now joined by Mos Def in the backstage area.
Thanks for coming and taking time out and chatting to us.
I heard they was doing something, so I came down.
I became aware of Amy in 2004.
I was out in England.
I'm a big jazz fan and I really liked what she was doing.
I thought it was unique, it was edgy and sincere.
And that's the thing I liked most about Amy, is that she didn't have any airs. She was real.
I had a chance to meet her while I was here, and we hit it off. We became fast friends.
She was just a charming, sweet lady.
I had a bit of a crush on her, to be honest.
She was raw, she was fast with a blue joke, could drink anybody under the table, wasn't afraid to roll a smoke, had a big giant laugh, and was just a sweetheart, you know?
You don't seem that bothered about everything.
D'you know what I mean? You have some artists 电视主持人 that step in here and go, "Right, I want that number-one spot.
I want my album to go number one, I wanna chase up with a second album."
But what's up with you?
I'm determined on the next thing.
I'm not interested in... Success, to me, is not success to... the record company or whoever.
Success, to me, is having the freedom to work with whoever I wanna work with, to always be able to just fuck everything off and go to the studio when I have to go to the studio, or... But you can't do that, 'cause you have other responsibilities now.
You're becoming an artist in the public eye.
So, all of a sudden, you're gonna be... I'm not saying you're gonna be hounded by the press, but you're gonna have certain responsibilities that are gonna come onto your doorstep that you may not particularly welcome.
Okay, that's cool, but I think the more people see of me, the more they'll realize that all I'm good for is making tunes.
So leave me alone and I'll do it.
I will do the music.
I just need time to do the music. Know what I mean?
I stopped working in January 2005, because I wasn't really creating at the time.
I should have written an album, but there was no inspiration for me to create at that time.
Do you understand me?
So I played pool for four hours every day, get drunk.
Have someone push you home in a trolley.
When she went to Camden, it was very exciting, because it was her first property that she'd bought, She loved Camden. She loved it up there But when she went to Camden, things started changing.
We were the indie kids.
Gazelles, The Rakes,Babyshambles.
Everyone was a Camden band. Like, it was cool again.
In them days, it was very much,like, basically, if you were in a signed band... you were a cunt, because... the best-looking and the best-dressed and the coolest people were the ones who were born to lose, really.
(Amy): The Libertines, yeah.  I slept on them.
I came to the Libertines, like, a year later than everyone else.
But I'm not being funny.
They made people proud That was London for a real spell, you know?
I run a club called Trash with my friend Errol.
Did the door there.
Blake would give out flyers for Trash.
We wouldn't have met each other, and a lot of people here  wouldn't have known each other had it not been for Trash.That's fair enough, innit?
It's the first place I learned how to pull a bird.
（Spiky):He just loved girls, you know?
He loved partying and he loved... shagging.
Always in and out of bed.
We met in a pub,   in the Good Mixer in Camden.
I was at the bar and she came in.
We just sort of started playing pool then we went to another pub.
And then we went back to Amy's house.
She was seeing somebody else and I was seeing somebody else.
But I didn't think of it as infidelity.
I just thought she was, like, a young girl and she was a bit naughty. And I was the same.
Until i met blake, I just learned it from him, if you don't pursue it, if you don't really start to devote yourself to You'll never know how good things could be.
Life is too short.
(woman): Are you alright? How you doing? You okay?
What's going on with you at the moment?
'Cause obviously, Frank was last year, um, and we haven't really heard much from you since then.
So when are we gonna hear from you next?
What's the next single?
Uh, I can't think of the next single.
I'm just gonna write the next album at the minute.
You having that kind of writer's block thing or        Yeah, man.
It's hard to write, because, uh, you can write a million things a day, but it's hard to write something that you're proud of.
So I'm just trying, you know, I'm just trying.
I asked to see her.
She was late and she came in with Nicky.
She was late and she came in with Nicky.
She was a character.
She always called me Uncle Lucian.
And I really liked her. And I had enough of a relationship with her. So there's no flattery, it was, like, blunt. And I said, "Enough, I need another album.
"Now go and write one. This is horseshit.
"Frank was then, this is now.
They're all gonna forget you."
She didn't like it.
(Amy): Nick Shymansky.        Yes.
Sit up a bit.
Yes.        How are you today, darling?
Very good, actually. Thanks.
How about you?        Really good.
In between all this,she decided that she wanted me In between all this,she decided that she wanted me to leave 19 with Simon Fuller to go manage her.
She didn't like being connected with Pop Idol and the Spice Girls, but I thought it would be incredibly disloyal, at this point, to walk away.
And Blake was very quickly becoming a bigger and bigger character in all this.
She was with him the whole time and didn't want to go to places without him.
We spent the summer together.
She used to say we're like twins.
And that was our relationship. I'd like to sabotage myself and I think Amy liked to sabotage herself.
Maybe that was our nature.
I used to ask her why was she promiscuous and why she was more like a man with sex.
It's indicative of somebody that's had a traumatic event, maybe sexually, themselves.
Sort of made sense to me from the way she was.
She'd just say, "It's nothing.
"I weren't abused when I was a kid.
Nothing like that."
Then she said her dad leaving her mum was what caused this, and her not really seeing her dad.
I understood.
I cut my wrists when I was nine years old.
I don't know if I wanted to necessarily die, I just wanted my mum to leave my stepdad.
Me and Amy were quite similar.
(Amy): I fell in love with someone who I would've died for.
We were in love and we were together.
And that's like a real drug, isn't it?
(Lauren): Oh, let's see who's gonna be behind the green door!
Hi!        Master of the house is not in right now.
She is gone somewhere for a minute to be somewhere.
She is gone somewhere for a minute to be somewhere.
And somewhere she having dinner, so I'm having a cheeky cigarette 马略卡岛 西班牙 while she gone. Don't tell her. Shh.
Cheeky, cheeky. Eh!
Mi scusi. Tell me about this place.
Alright, while she's away, I'll give you a tour of the house. Okay, ready? Okay.
First I lead you into the main room.
This is usually reserved for entertaining guests, but you can be my guest, darling, because no one's here today.
Okay, I lead you out to the grand patio.
Please, please follow. Don't mind me in my... Ah, where you go?        Okay, darling, this is the grand patio. This is Cecil.
Cecil live here.        Cecil!
Then we have the bedroom. It's very nice.
There are some cupboards.
Ooh.        See up here, this is where I sleep when the master come home.
The toilet!        Sometimes when I'm alone, I have a shower in all my clothes.
I find this is the only true way to relax.
Also here, this is the hook I hang from when I'm in trouble.
It's not very often. I'm a good boy. I'm a good boy.
Okay, well, this is it. Welcome to my humble abode.
(Lauren): Amy!
We are sitting... in a little bar, drinking cocktails. There's my cocktail.
There's Amy's little cocktail.
I think it's got Rohypnol in it.
"Lauren, listen to this message. This is a message from Blake."
"Lauren, listen to this message. This is a message from Blake."
I just said to her that I didn't wanna leave my girlfriend I just said to her that I didn't wanna leave my girlfriend and we'd probably be better as friends.
and we'd probably be better as friends.
(Lauren): She was obsessing over these text messages.
He wanted nothing to do with her and she was obsessing over it.
All she wanted was for him to wanna see her.
It got messy.
He went back to his girlfriend, then she got her own back.
She slept with his friend.
I know it's totally fucked up I know when he finds out he won't talk to me anymore I know I have to do this. Someone must come to kill my thoughts.
Because we keep hurting each other's hearts over and over again.
When it was all over I went crazy, completely crazy, don't care about anything, completely crazy.
Everything reminds me of him.
I looked at the refrigerator and thought of him.
When I went up the fucking stairs and saw the blood on the wall, I thought of him.
Because I used to smash the wall with my hands, The person that lived opposite in the little court had Juliette's number and had called Juliette up to say, "Amy's fallen over and she's hurt her head, so we've gone round there."
so we've gone round there."
It looked like people had been squatting in her house.
It stank, it was dirty.And she was lying on the bed and she had this golf ball coming out of her head.
So we worked till, like, 3 in the morning and we cleaned the whole house up.
And I called her dad and we called Nick.
The thing is because I was depressed, I wasn’t eating Obviously you lose your appetite when you do stuff like that So it wasn’t like,the amount I was drinking What's more important is drinking speed.
I just don’t think about anything anymore, you know?
So you drink as soon as you get up in the morning?
Yeah,literally wake up and go for a bottle We all met there and it was, like, this is getting out of control. We need to get her some help.
I've tried speaking to the parents and they really wanna kinda take it on.
And so, technically, I sort of kidnapped her.
I picked her up and I thought, "I'm driving you "to the middle of nowhere and we're gonna sit there until you acknowledge what's going on."
I drove her to Black Park in Iver.
And it started off with her sort of laughing, "You're such an idiot."
And then it turned into, "Don't be a prick."
And she kicked my car.
And then she just broke down, eventually.
Opened up about everything.
She said she thinks she's got a problem, she was lost and out of her depth.
Horrible.
She agreed to go rehab.
I took her to see the rehab guy.
She was, like, "I don't wanna talk about it.
I'll go if my dad thinks I should go."
We'd spoken to Mitch. We'd set it all up and she turned into a seven-year-old child.
Sat on her father's lap and put her arm around him.
I said to the managers, "She doesn't need to go to rehab. She's fine."
(Amy): My dad did actually go, "You're alright, no need to go."
I said, "Alright, Dad, I'll go and meet him and we'll back out." Which I did.
(Mitch): She didn't need to go to rehab.
(Nick): I think that was the moment we lost a very key opportunity.
I'm not saying it would've worked.
Very often, you have to go two or three times.
But she wasn't a star. She wasn't swarmed by paparazzi.
We could've just fucked Back to Black off, and Back To Black might have never happened, but she'd have had a chance to have been dealt with by professionals before the world wanted a piece of her.
Your favorite Jewish girl apart from your mum I don’t know what you’re playing at But I miss you very,very much and love you The love I for you... The burning love that I have for you will not be dampened by the fact That you don’t answer the phone to me ever It simply won't!
I don’t care if you never answer the phone to me again I will continue to love you unconditionally Until the day that my heart fails and I fall down dead So,please call me whenever I’m not going anywhere Bye!
The label were considering letting her go.
She ends up coming back to Miami.
Guy Moot calls me up, "Hey, sure you wanna do this?"
制作人 I was, like, "Listen, even if you dropped her, "I would pay her to come to my house and sing 'cause this shit fucking moves me."
And she totally didn't drink the whole time she was here.
And she sat out in my back garden for, I don't know, four days.
She'd just take her little notebook and just keep writing.
(Amy): A.
Took me a while to get my head around a lot of things.
The actual turning point, when I was alright with it, was when I started writing the album.
I write songs because I'm fucked up in the head and I need to put it on paper and then write a song to it and to feel better about it.
Have something good out of something bad.
The ideas were there. Four or five songs were there.
You can feel something creatively starting to happen.
But I was still very worried about her health.
She's really vulnerable and not in a good place.
And then she said, "So, listen, are you leaving 19 to manage me?"
And I said, "D'you know what?
"Unless you let me help you sort yourself out, "I'm not doing this shit for you.
I can't watch you do yourself in like this."
I remember she came to see me to talk about wanting to change management.
I said, "Look, that's entirely your decision.
2001-08小岛唱片主席 We will support you whatever you wanna do."
Then she said she wanted to be managed by Raye Cosbert.
All I thought is, "Why on earth are you gonna be managed 大都会音乐策划人 I remember at the time thinking, We're now gonna deal with a promoter whose main interest will be to get her out on the road.
And we knew she was very vulnerable on the road.
When I first met Amy, I was her concert promoter.
We got talking and she said that her contract was up with 19 We got talking and she said that her contract was up with 19 and she wanted to explore other possibilities.
大都会音乐策划人 She said, "Would you like to do it?"
And I was, like, "Well, yeah, let's talk about it."
We got on quite well, you know. I'd be the guy that'd turn up after the gig and say, "Well done, have a glass of bubbly." And I thought, "Well, sometimes someone just wants a change because they feel it's right for them to change."
It's like switching bank accounts.
(Nick): I was way too close to Amy.
I shouldn't have ever been that close.
It should've been business.
But when you're 19, you meet a 16-year-old and you go through that, you don't understand that.
We'd spent all these years together.
And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I wasn't there.
(Amy): When I started writing the first song about Blake, the other songs just wrote themselves.
I was really was on a roll. Because I had these feelings, had these words floating around in me.
When you write a song, you have to remember how you felt, what the weather was like, what his neck smelt like.
You have to remember all of it.
She would tell me stories about Blake and this tempestuous, extreme relationship.
That first day, she wrote Back to Black, all the lyrics and the melody, in two or three hours.
Oh, it's a bit upsetting at the end, isn't it?
Rrrr... Boom, boom, boom.
(Mark): I love that. Yes, Amy.
Yeah!
(Mark): It was just one of those serendipitous things.
Like, I just caught her at that magic moment, you know, and she was just ready to get it going.
That's why I couldn't understand what everyone else was saying about this procrastinating, troubled artist.
I went out to New York to kinda hear what they were doing.
I went out to New York to kinda hear what they were doing.
小岛唱片艺人与作品部 And the day I was flying out, I got a call from management saying that Amy's nan had fallen ill and she wanted to get straight back to her nan.
My nan is the strongest woman in my entire life Everything I have,I pretty much owe to my nan All my strengths I owe to my nan Cynthia used to look after Amy.
母亲 She was like the mother that I didn't have.
My own mother was not really motherly to me.
So Amy and Cynthia were very, very close.
(Mitch): My mum died May 5th, 2006.
She had lung cancer.
Cynthia was a very strong person in her life and used to tell her how it is. So it was horrible for her.
That killed her inside.
Well, hang on, I'm not playing this track now.
Not playing this track now.
I'm not playing this track now.
I spoke to them and they said it's just unnecessary.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
We were making the back end of the record and we were at Metropolis Studios and Amy had bits of vocal to finish.
Have I got any drink? Did they bring up that drink?
It's quite fun, really.        An acoustic session?
Never been filmed like this. I've never done it before.
She was having a couple of whiskey-and-Cokes.
We had broke for lunch.
Amy had ordered this massive plate of food and she had a big dessert as well.
She finished the whole thing off and she disappeared for a while, and 45 minutes later came back a bit kind of dazed.
And the studio manager pulled me out of the session and said, "Look, I need you to come and see something."
She took me to the women's toilets and Amy had thrown everything up and literally redecorated the toilets.
She'd obviously been wiping her face, and all the mascara had been rubbed off on the towels.
And that's when I kinda realized that something serious was wrong.
I had a toffee fudge... but I ate it.
Yummy.
When she was probably 15, she one day said, "I've got this really great diet, Mum.
I eat what I want and then, I just bring it all up."
I know, I'm a pig.
I know I'm a pig, I just... can't help it.
(Janis): I obviously did not think that deeply of it.
My feeling was, it would pass.
And then she told Mitchell about it.
He also sort of pushed it aside, not taking it seriously.
That basically is bulimia.
And it doesn't pass.
(man): Hello.        (Amy): Hello. You alright?
Welcome to the show. Now, you've been away for a little while. What have you been up to?
I've done an album. It's called Back To Black.
Mm-hmm. How would you describe it?
but it's not got all the clever, like, jazz chords.
It's not really like that now. I've been listening to a lot of girl groups, a lot of garage bands.
It's kinda what it's like. It's a lot more guitar.
I'm a guitarist, I've been listening to a lot more guitar bands. In Camden, you can't really get away from it, so... You can't.        It rubbed off on me.
Would you go as far as to say it's a bit more accessible than your debut?
I'd say it was more accessible.
It's not necessarily more poppy, but, you know, jazz is quite an exclusive. Not exclu... It's quite an elitist music, you know, and this album's a lot less like that.
So let's talk about your music, then.
And Rehab has gone down so well.
Are you kind of surprised by the reaction to it?
Uh... I am, actually.
I never even thought it'd be a single, really.
The record company were like, "We want it to be a single." And I was, like, "Okay, I love all of it," know what I mean?
I'm really proud of it.
Now, the Q Awards, which you were at yesterday.
Did you have a good time?
I had too good a time, to be honest.
If that's possible.
Alcohol is bad, kids.
Can you tie that any tighter?
What are you doing? You have to be able to sing.
How can you breathe when you're singing? That's tight.
Breathe? Sing? What?
There was already this atmosphere of celebrity... There was already this atmosphere of celebrity... all tied into Rehab.
Rehab was the pivotal song.
It was the song that gets her into a particular place, her becoming a commercial star.
The winner of the Best British Female this year, way more rock'n'roll than Liam Gallagher, it's the one, the only... Amy Winehouse!
Has the Brits win changed anything?
Was the any sort of breakthrough moment in your own head?
Or has it just been,for you,pretty gradual?
No,I don’t really watch stuff like that I know it sounds like a line,you know?
The more I trot it out the less you probably believe that I don’t really see that stuff like that but I fucking don’t If I really thought I was famous,I’d fucking go and top myself or something Because it’s frightening,do you know what I mean?
It’s a scary thing,it’s very scary Okay, let's just go. Get the... get the... Go.
Ali, just go, man.
Ooh. Rach, this is Blake. He's my fiancé.
Hello.
Turn the volume up!
We're kickin' off the 107 days of summer, on 107.5, WBLS!
I love, not like, Amy Winehouse, because her voice is the most original voice that I've heard in the last, I dunno, 10 years.
My daughter turned on to it, everybody got turned on to it.
And I've turned all my friends on to it.
Her CD is entitled Back to Black.
Please welcome Amy Winehouse.
Amy called me. Then I saw her in New York.
She was almost embarrassed by the fact that she was doing so well.
She expressed a lot of concern and fear about where things were gonna go and how she was gonna handle it.
She was just, like, "What am I supposed to do in this space, you know?"
Amy Winehouse! Nice job! Thank you very, very much!
Everybody just wanted to spend time with Amy.
In our business, 共和唱片CEO兼主席） there's nothing that can prepare you 共和唱片CEO兼主席） for that level of success.
There's no textbook. You can warn an artist, you can try and prepare them for it, but at the end of the day, until you go through it, it's unlike anything you've ever encountered.
(man): By yourself! By yourself! By yourself!!
(Blake): How do you think the shoot's going, baby?
Really well, baby!        Yeah? Enjoying yourself?
What's it like to be shot by Terry Richardson?
What's he like at shooting?
It's a lifelong dream come true.
What do you think about the broken glass?
Um, I wrote "I love Blake" on my tummy.
Did you? Did you outline it?
I wrote "I love Blake" on my tummy.
I can't see any scars.
It's just chicken scratch.
So what's been your highlight of the day?
Um... it'll be in about five minutes.
When?
We go in the toilet and I fucking... Blake, sit here.        Yes, Terry, sir.
Amy, sit there.
Amy.
That's good, that's lovely.
You've been famous in the UK for a little while longer.
Does it seem like it's different how you're treated here, in a way too, compared to... The way people write about you, it's almost like a 23-year-old's never wanted go out and have fun before.
It's kind of hypocritical, in a way, too.
(Amy): Uh... I wouldn't know, I really wouldn't know.
That’s just the British press it means nothing Um... you guys have known each other for a long time.
You've known each other... You grew up together?
(Blake): Almost.        Almost?
It feels like that,yeah We met about two and a half years ago You were fighting to get her back?
There was a few other hurdies in the way It’s taken tenacity and fucking perseverance There’s no way we were never going to be together Who’s paying for this,I’m broke?
Amy Can we get a bottle of Dom Perignon?
How was today?
Why? What happened?
What happened?
Dunno...What happened?
Hold on... You got up and... I went somewhere with her And what happened?
Some part announced us husband and wife I don’t know who he was The day we got married, we went out on a boat around Miami, we went out on a boat around Miami, smoked a cigar and... it was like a real achievement, an amazing thing that me and her had actually done.
We'd actually gotten married.
And we did it exactly how we wanted to.
(Spiky): You lazy people!
Hurray! Wave!
Her whole thing was she wanted to feel how he felt.
 菲尔·梅内尔 And she was, "I just wanna feel what he's feeling.
"I wanna be on the same level.
Otherwise he's there and I'm here."
That's what she wanted, that was the goal.
Welcome back to 45th at Night.
Please give a warm, warm round of applause for Amy Winehouse.
Thank you very much.
Oh, have they? Bollocks.Have they? Fuck.
艾米在卡姆登的公寓 I heard about that as well.
Amy, can you talk in the kitchen?
After we came back from America, married, After we came back from America, married, that was the first time Amy tried crack cocaine and heroin.
I'd used by then and enjoyed it.
It completely eradicates any sort of negative feelings.
And then Amy tried it with me.
And it just got a grip of both of us really quickly from then.
Amy.
Yeah?        Come in here.
Coming!        Oh, change the record.
Just come on.
Pass me a little, uh... Come on!
Are you alright keeping the rollers in?
Yeah.        Yeah?
Do you ever have time to stand back and think, "This is alright. Quite good, this."
Yeah. Uh... Uh, I dunno. Yeah, I suppose so.
I suppose if my husband's happy, I'm happy. Um... But, yeah, I've done well, I've done really well.
But, um... I just want to be able to go and do a next... an album again, and... keep doing... just keep doing music really well, rather than... I love doing gigs, though.
I just want to go and do another album now, so... Yeah.
I got a phone call in the middle of the night, and Blake said to me, "Something's happened.
"She doesn't know who I am and she keeps saying your name.
Can you come round?" So obviously I got up, Can you come round?" So obviously I got up, and I got in the car and I started driving.
I got a phone call from Blake,freaking out, off his nut, I got a phone call from Blake,freaking out, off his nut, 前经纪人&朋友 saying she's overdosed.
And I said, "Right.
Go to the closest hospital now and I'll be there."
(Juliette): She was petrified. He was petrified.
She looked like a child.
She scared herself, basically.
(Nick): And the doctor called us into a room and said, "With the amount of cocaine, heroin, "alcohol and crack cocaine in her blood system, "we're amazed she's not in a coma.
"You've got away with it this time, "but she's a petite, young girl; her body can't keep up with this."
(Juliette): She was asleep and it was very calm.
Nicky was one side of the bed,I was the other side of the bed, and we said, "What are we gonna do now?
How do we deal with this?"
And then it all just started up.
The whole circus started up again.
(Nick): And that's when Raye and Mitch decided to do an intervention.
Within... hours, there were Sun, The Mirror, News Of The World journalists booked up in every room.
Every single conversation that happened was in the Sun and The Mirror.
Fuck knows if they were hacking the phones or whatever.
And there's pictures of all of us there, sat outside.
(Juliette): Amy was awake by then and she was eating, but she wasn't well and she wasn't right.
The doctor that they got in looked me dead in the eye and he said to me, "If she has another seizure, she'll die."
And then I was told that she was going to America to perform.
I was, like, "No, she's not."
We had Mitchell in a hotel room with us, begging him, "Please do something."
"What am I gonna do? She's gotta go on tour."
"Take her passport away from her, do something so she can't go on tour. She needs help."
"Can't do that, she's got a tour booked."
(Juliette): So I went into her room and I stole her passport.
And then I got told, "What you done that for?
She's gotta go to America. Why have you done that?"
(Nick):The doctor's just been round to check her blood and check everything.
Blake's managed to get to Hook, get into her bedroom, and the next checkup, the doctors found out she's got heroin in her blood again.
(Lauren): When I found out, with the girls, that she was taking heroin, and we went to this hotel room that she was staying in, and Amy just sat there and didn't really say anything.
Her manager then said something like, "Girls, there are lots of professionals, "lawyers and doctors, all sorts of people, that function on this stuff."
In helping promote the album,and get the shows on the road, In helping promote the album,and get the shows on the road, 经纪人 I kind of done what I was supposed to do.
And I felt that it's now the family's responsibility.
I'm here, but there's only so much I can do about this.
(newswoman): Amy Winehouse has pulled out of a string of concerts in the U.S. and Canada next month because of health issues. The 23-year-old... Now she's one of Britain's brightest talents, but the singer Amy Winehouse has cancelled yet more gigs, this time in Norway, after she was admitted to a hospital in London yesterday.
Her record company said it was just down to severe exhaustion, but with her reputation for hard drinking and drugs... The Amy link came about through Russell Brand, The Amy link came about through Russell Brand, who was trying to get Amy to come into rehab.
And then, also, Mitch had gotten involved.
And I first met Amy when she came with Blake to be assessed for treatment.
It was very much being led by Blake, although I did think she was probably more willing to go to rehab than he was.
She was a very vulnerable woman.
And I felt very clearly that it was a common case of one person having a situation that was very beneficial to their using, not wanting the other person to get better for fear of losing the gravy train.
They were insistent on doing rehab together, which, of course, we would've considered to be disastrous.
I would personally find it almost unethical to take the couple into treatment at the same time.
But her management, and Mitch, managed to find somewhere where they could go together.
(Blake): Oh, it's recording shit.
It won't stop.
Amy, got anything to say?
Only if you sing your favourite hit, Rehab.
Where are we right now? Amy?
Alex, can you say? Where are we?
Known to some as... So can we have the new updated version of Rehab, please, Amy?
First time? Amy?
I want the new version of Rehab.
Please, baby, for our personal private movie.
They came back from Osea Island, and had a suite at the hotel,and they binged.
It was ugly.
They weren't happy souls when they were high.
I kicked off... I broke a bottle and I cut my arm.
And then she grabbed the bottle off me and she nicked her arm, and she said, "I'll do anything you do."
She said, "Love is, in some ways, killing me, Raye Raye."
She felt torn between those two things:
the guy that she really loved, but having to keep up with the consumption of substances that they both were trying to do at the same time.
It was just a horrible pendulum swinging one way to the other, one extreme to the other, all the time.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, Amy Winehouse!
And I've worked with a lot of people.
I'm telling you, she has one of the best voices of anybody of all time. Amy Winehouse!
More trouble for Amy Winehouse.
The singer's Camden home was raided by police last night, who used a battering ram to smash down her front door.
This was the moment police arrested and handcuffed Blake Fielder-Civil on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice.
A spokesman for the star saying she was in no way connected with the arrest.
Shut the door.
When he went to jail,  经纪人 she spiralled...  经纪人 downward very quickly.

We did everything within our power to help Amy.
But you can't force treatment on somebody.
And I felt that that's Amy's responsibility to get herself well.
I'm sorry... Okay, fellas, make some room, please.
This way, this way.        Can't see the steps.
where everybody was doing everything for her.
And that's not real life.
We had the Grammys coming up. I said, "You need to be clean.
If you're not clean, you're not doing anything."
So I had a contract drawn up and it said, "You, Amy Winehouse, "have agreed to go to a facility now.
"You're never gonna make another record again, "you're never going to perform ever again unless you get clean."
And God bless her, she did.

Amy's completely clean and looking amazing.
Amy's completely clean and looking amazing.
It's just overwhelming.
It's just overwhelming.
I was just hysterically crying.
I was so overwhelmed, I was so proud of her.
And I was just flashing our whole life, our childhood.
And then she saw me crying.
Juliette, come up.
She grabbed me, pulled me up onstage and took me off the stage.
And I was having a bit of a panic attack.
I was, like, "I can't believe this is happening.
This is amazing. I'm so proud of you."
And I'm looking at her, trying to get some form of reaction, and she went, "Jules, this is so boring without drugs."
And I felt really, really, really sad for her.
(man): Amy? Amy?
Amy? Amy?
Amy, how do you feel after winning a Grammy?
Congratulations.        Did you enjoy it?
Whoops. Sorry.        I'm going to see my husband.
I was staying at the K-West Hotel.
Very late in the night,she knocks on the door, and I'm alone.
She comes in, and she just sits on the couch.
I remember feeling like really happy for her, and also concerned, 'cause she really didn't know how to be that thing that she had been pushed to become from her own success.
Then she pulled out this aluminum foil.
She said, "Does this bother you?"
And I said, "Amy, I love you.
"I don't mind that you get high, but I mind that you get high."
She did what she did and I was, like, "This is someone who is trying to disappear."
Do you like being famous?
I don’t really know what... I don’t think there’s any such thing,to be honest How do you mean?Obviously you are famous... I don’t know...it doesn’t mean bollocks Is it hard to know who you can trust?
Yeah Gents, get away from the door, please.
Fuck off, please. Sorry, mate.
I was called out to do security for her.
The security that she had, it just could not handle the whole paparazzi situation.
See ya.        Night-night, Amy.
I could feel that she was a humble person, but she was just caught up in a bad situation.
She was not well at all: physically, mentally not well.
She was not well at all: physically, mentally not well.
All she ever wanted was people to tell her, "Pack it in, stop it."
And me and Lauren would not tolerate any of it.
It was Nick that said, "The only thing you girls can do "is show her you don't want to be a part of it, and when she needs help, you're there for her."
Tough love.
And I just said to her, "If you want me to help you, I'll help you.
"I love you, but I don't like who you've become, and I don't want to be around you."
Where a lot of money and a lot of expectation is at stake, people's ideas become a bit skewed.
They want to try and get it sorted out in a way that doesn't upset this financial trajectory that's going on.
From the 6th of September, we're not gonna be doing any more work for the foreseeable future.
Amy's going to be concentrating on writing her new album.
Uh... there's five gigs, which, contractually, we are obliged to do.
There's a couple this weekend.
It was all over the media that Amy was getting $1 million for some shows.
Huge money. But by that point, it was much more likely to not be a good show She just wanted to get better.She knew that things were wrong, and she was just very exhausted and tired of the whole situation.
(Nick):She couldn't escape her life in this horrible goldfish bowl.
She'd began to unravel in public and the media treatment pushed her further and further over the edge.
D'you see Amy Winehouse in the paper this week?
My God!
She looks like a campaign poster for neglected horses.
Easy, lad.
It was like a feeding frenzy.
Suddenly, it was cool to crack jokes about a bulimic's appearance or her drug addictions.
According to contactmusic.com, Amy Winehouse's next album features songs about cooking, about cooking.
That's what they say.Cooking crystal meth, That's what they say.Cooking crystal meth, black-tar heroin.
Amy, cheer up.
(Nick): She couldn't escape it.
No one would leave her alone.
It was just disgusting.
The mainstream media was just all over her.
Amy Winehouse, she's like a... a mad person.
St. Lucia was our place.
We were supposed to be there for a week, we ended up there for, like, six months.
You know, as soon as she went to St. Lucia, there was no more crack cocaine. That was done.
And that's when the heroin stopped.
But give her a free bar, of course she's gonna drink.
It was kind of obvious that she was just supplementing alcohol for drugs.
I haven't seen Amy for six weeks.
We've got a lot to talk about, a lot of  exciting things happening.
We're talking about the forthcoming album, some other business matters.
So I think it's... it's gonna be an exciting time.
Ah-ah! Naughty!
Amy, Amy!
She was, like, "Why is he bringing another camera crew to St. Lucia?
"Why is he bringing another camera crew to St. Lucia?
"Dad, you want money? I'll give you money.
"Why are you doing your life story, which is really my life story?"
She just felt like, "My dad's doing a lot of stuff for money or the limelight."
Want me to go with you?        Yeah.
You can follow down, if you want.
I thought we’d ask first.We’re fans from England Can we get a picture with Amy?
I'll ask her.
Amy? How do you do it?
Just push and hold the button. I'm really sorry.
Is that alright? All the way from Listen,if you were that sorry,then you wouldn’t... you’ve got a lovely shirt on... Okay!
Is that okay?        Thank you.
Pleasure.        Thank you.
Why have you got to make a comment like that?
Why... why... why you got to do that?
Because I don’t want to be made a mug out of ,dad A mug of? They asked to take a picture of you.
Richard... Dad,Dad,you don’t want to make a mug of me?
Be nice to me on camera then No, that's got nothing to do with it. I'm talking to you about those two people who wanted a lousy photograph, and you got to make them feel bad about it.
No,I didn’t make them feel bad about it dad They got the photo they wanted I don’t think they give a fuck about anything else She just wanted her dad, and he didn't just come by himself, he came with cameras, audio guys... But she worshipped the ground he walked on.
It's not easy to go through things like that.
To put it bluntly, I didn't have a very high opinion of myself after the treatment I've had for the past two years with my wife.
I kind of just had the wind knocked out of my sails.
So I just thought, "Fuck this. You know. I'm a big man.
"I'm a handsome fucking guy. I ain't on heroin.
"I'm going to the gym a lot, I dress well.
So what the fuck am I doing wasting my time with her?"
You always hurt the ones you love That’s why I had to twist the blade Goodbyes ain’t my forte Hat tipped,you go your way You’ll never meet a girl like me I’ll never meet a boy like you No-one who knew what we went through Would designate us someone new And then the chorus come in. And, um, the last verse is:
As black as Fat Kams’ market trade White as the rap sheet of a dove This is the way you switched the blade You always hurt the ones you love She kind of became my entire family It was just us,just us Only people she can talk to Anything that your daughter would probably want to say to you Why her period don’t come?Why can’t I get pregnant?
Anything at all If I know that she wanted to go down to the pub and I know that she have something to do tomorrow then she was not going down to the pub you can thank me tomorrow I wasn’t going to sugarcoat it or nothing If it’s not right,I’m gonna tell you it’s not right She needed someone to say no She just needed support Hello,doll,it’s Amy Salaam,yeah,I keep coming out with all battle raps and... they’re just pouring out of me Like Wu-Tang stuff,like But really neat,very beautifully alliterated little battle raps So next time you wanna come for me and have a battle rap-off... I’m gonna kill you because Before you ask yourself,”Is she drunk..?Is she high...?
Has she been out?What has she been doing?
Yeah I’m fucked up,I’m fucked up in the head But I keep coming out with all this stuff all the time All these lyrics and... I don’t know why?
But I realise it’s for the next album So,come on Sensei...let’s do this!Love you,Bye My son came up with the idea of getting the most contemporary artists, and I kept saying to myself, "Who sings the right way, the real jazz singing?"
And when I heard Amy Winehouse, I immediately said, "This one's got it."
Everybody just said, "Oh, I don't know how you're gonna handle her."
Where do you want to be?        I'll be here.
Okay.This is weird.
I've never done anything like this.
In which way?
To sing with one of my idols... Oh, no...        ...and have it filmed.
But it's good, it's good, 'cause then, I can make my dad jealous, after, when I show him, when he sees it.
Sorry, sorry, that was me.
I was terrible. I was terrible.        No, no… I don't want to waste your time.
It's getting better each time. Don't... Really.
I just don't wanna waste your time.
We'll keep doing it till we got one.
It's right in there, okay?
You're not in any hurry, are you?
No! Of course I'm not.        I'm not either. We have time.
Just gotta get it right, I've got to get it right.
I'm not getting it right.        Oh, you are, you are.
It's getting better each time and you sound wonderful.
Just a minute, I'm getting some water.
The most famous artists I ever met are the most nervous before they hit that stage.
No matter how much you feel it, you want to feel it even more, so that it becomes an honest recording.
And that's what Amy had. She had that gift.
She was a natural, true jazz singer.
And a jazz artist doesn't like 50,000 people in front of him.
Thank you!
I think we got it.        Yeah.
Okay        I'm like you, you know?
Each time, it's different.        Yeah. No, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
It's never the same thing twice, right? Yeah.
No, I'm like you. Not you're like me.
I get it from... my idols, like you.
That's the right way to do it.
She skyped me. She was happy.
The Tony Bennett thing, I mean, she was, you know, a fan.
It was about her saying,"I'm not a singer, I'm a jazz singer." Then she said, "Let's do this jazz project with Questlove..."
She's such a jazz snob.
She'd always be on her computer sending me MP3s.
She'd always be on her computer sending me MP3s.
"Listen to this, listen to this, listen to this."
"Listen to this, listen to this, listen to this."
I thought I had my doctorate in jazz, but no, she taught me a lot.
She was, like, "Alright, we're gonna start a super group:
you, me, Mos and Raphael Saadiq."
I was, like, "Okay." And she assigned homework.
"Alright, study this record, study this record..."
Amy had a good period.
She could go for four weeks at a time with no alcohol.
And she very much felt that she was the best that she has ever been.
But she went to the Priory, in May, to be checked, and there was some very... serious things that were being spotted.
It was the cumulative effect of drinking and bulimia.
She could feel perfectly fine and have heart irregularities.
Her heart can stop if she started drinking again.
I said, "Look, is this what you want?
Do you want to die?"
And she said, "No, I don't want to die."
All the signs were positive. I thought, "Right, okay, we've got a little chink of light."
The Tony Bennett thing was a good catalyst, and it shows that she still had it.
We had the offers to do these shows, and I said to her, "You don't have to do them.
There's no pressure. We got no record to promote."
But she wanted to do it.
She skyped me.
She wanted to do all these other projects 制作人 with Questlove and Mos Def.
She was, like, "I don't need this."
She just didn't wanna go.
The material felt so tired and didn't feel relevant to her anymore.
But because she was such a huge star and there was all of these different pressures, she had to keep performing Back to Black.
She didn't want to do that.
As soon as she knew that tour was looming, As soon as she knew that tour was looming, she got wasted, wasted so that she wouldn't be able to go.
Amy was passed out, asleep, on her sofa.
She gets put in the back of a car, asleep, and she wakes up at the airport and gets put on a private jet.
She didn’t want to do it she told everybody she didn’t want to do it but apparently she had to do it Can’t go anywhere,can’t hide anywhere but she needed an escape Then the drinking start escape route innit?
Belgrade!
Introducing Amy Winehouse!
Whoo!
I wasn't sure what was going on.
She just wouldn't sing.
It was the first time ever that had happened.
She’s totally messed up She’s shitfaced,she doesn’t know where she is Look at her,look at her!
Sing or give me my money back!
It felt like the end.
It was someone who just really didn't care anymore.
To the extent where she was willing To the extent where she was willing to sabotage not just her career, but her friendships and her musical relationships.
But it's amazing to me. Why keep putting her onstage?
Because surely her managers know she has a problem.
This was supposed to be a major comeback, guys, and she totally blew it.
Go!
A few days afterwards The good news is -now I can go to Nicky’s wedding!
The 24th of July was my wedding day, and Amy was due to be at the wedding, and we'd spoken and I felt like she was really excited about my wedding, actually.
And she said she hadn't been drinking and she can't wait to see the family, and Salaam, and some people that had been on the journey were gonna be there.
She rang me up and I thought, "Oh, my God, what's happened now?"
"Oh, my God, what's happened now?"
that's the first thing that goes in my head.
And she just went, "Jules..."
And it was my Amy, completely normal.
And it was my Amy, completely normal.
And she kept saying she'd never done this before.
She just kept saying sorry. It was like complete clarity over the whole situation of the nightmare of the past however many years that we'd just gone through.
"Jules, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry..."
Like when you're a kid and you panic that you've done something wrong and you wanna just fix it there and then, that's how it was.
I just wanted to grab her, bring her back to me, wrap her in my house, not let her out.
And she called me the next day, and it was just so weird hearing her talk normally, because for so long, we'd just been pining for her... Like, I missed my best friend, Lauren missed her best friend.
We just wanted to have a normal conversation.
She just kept going, "Can I see you?
Will Lauren speak to me? Can we start again?"
I was, like, "Of course, we can, we're always here.
We've been waiting for you to talk to us."
She said, "I'm gonna call you tomorrow."
I was, like, "Okay, I love you." "I love you too."
She just looked like she was sleeping.
She was on top of the bed, just... sleeping.
But she was gone.
Friday night she was showing me some clips on her laptop She was singing on the stage And she said,”Boy,I can sing!” I said,”Damn right you can sing.” She said,”If I could give it back” just to walk down that street with no hassle I would.
No!        Oh, my God.
Rest in peace, Amy!
Amy's blood alcohol level was four to five times higher than the driving limit.
Maybe a combination of her eating disorders and the alcohol just made her heart stop.
She was one of the truest jazz singers I ever heard.
She had the complete gift.
If she had lived, I would've said, "Slow down, you're too important."
Life teaches you really how to live it if you can live long enough.
I think I've read somewhere, maybe someone told me that when you were a child you used to dream as a man.
Yeah. I was typically a man, I went on adventures.
How come?
Probably because at the time I wanted to do things which men did and women didn't.
You know going to Africa, living with animals, that's all I ever thought about.
Everything led in the most natural way.
It seems now, to that magical invitation to Africa in 1957 where I would meet Dr. Louis Leakey, who had sent me on my way to Gombe and the chimpanzees.
I had no training, no degree.
But Louis didn't care about academic credentials.
What he was looking for was someone with an open mind, with a passion for knowledge, with a love of animals, and with monumental patience.
My mission was to get close to the chimpanzees, to live among them, to be accepted.
I wanted to come as close to talking to animals as I could.
To be like Doctor Doolittle.
I wanted to move among them without fear, like Tarzan.
The huge, gnarled, and ancient trees, the little streams chuckling their way through rocky pathways to the lake.
The birds. The insects.
Since I was eight or nine years old, I had dreamed of being in Africa, of living in the bush among wild animals.
And suddenly, I found I was actually living in my dream.
I already felt that I belonged to this new forest world.
That this was where I was meant to be.
When I arrived in Gombe, I had no idea what I was going to do except that I was going to try and get the chimpanzees used to me, so that I could really learn about what they were doing.
That was in the back of my mind because I'd watched other animals, and the only way to learn about them is when they know you're there, but they ignore you.
Except they can rip your face off.
Well, I didn't know that.
I didn't think about that!
There was nobody talking about that.
There was no fear of chimpanzees in the wild?
You have to realize that back then, there were no people out in the field whose research I could read about except this one man, and he saw chimps once or maybe twice in the three months of his study.
And then much earlier on, there was this crazy man who painted himself with baboon shit, I think, and sat in hides, in hopes that chimps would appear.
There were plenty of snakes, many poisonous snakes.
And to be honest, I always believed that if you walk carefully, you don't startle a snake, you don't tread on it, they're not going to hurt you.
I had this probably crazy feeling.
"Nothing's going to hurt me, I'm meant to be here."
I watched them feeding in a large fig tree.
Calling noisily from time to time.
The trees came alive.
And so began one of the most exciting periods of my life.
The time of discovery.
My life fell into a rhythm.
Day after day.
In the sun, and the wind and the rain.
I climbed into the hills and stayed with the chimps from dawn until darkness fell.
Most times I would encounter a group of chimps or a single chimp, but there were times when I couldn't find them at all.
And when I tried to get closer, they ran off as soon as they saw me.
I was an intruder.
And a strange one at that.
As I am not a defeatist, it only made my determination to succeed stronger.
I never had any thought of quitting.
I should forever have lost all self respect if I had given up.
I became totally absorbed into this forest existence.
I could give myself up to the sheer pleasure of being on my own in the rugged terrain that I was coming to know as well as I had known the Bournemouth cliffs as a child.
It was an unparalleled period.
When aloneness was a way of life.
And even as I was, bit by bit, piecing together something of their way of life, so they were getting used to the sight of the strange white ape.
It was not thought at all safe for a young, single girl to go into the wilds of Africa.
I had to choose a companion.
It was my mother who volunteered.
Mom set up a clinic.
She handed out medicine to many of the local fisherman.
Patients would walk for miles to get treatment.
What was your relationship like with your father?
I didn't really know my father.
He went off to the war.
When war broke out, I was five and of course I hugely admired him, but he didn't really care about children.
So, I couldn't say I had a relationship with him.
I think the most important part about my mother was that she listened.
She was always fair.
She was never angry without a reason.
She supported me and my love of animals.
She never said, "Well, you're just a girl. You can't do that.
Why don't you dream about something you can achieve?"
Which is what everybody else told me.
So it was my mother who really built up my self-esteem.
Like most children before the age of TV and computer games, I loved being outside.
Playing in the secret places in the garden, learning about nature.
I spent many hours high above the ground at the top of my favorite tree and I would read up there in my own leafy and private world.
It was daydreaming about life in the forest with Tarzan that lead to my determination to go to Africa to live with animals and write books about them.
I never had any aspiration of being married and having a family.
It just didn't come into my way of thinking.
It simply wasn't there.
You know, going to Africa, living with animals.
That's all I ever thought about.
We were by no means a wealthy family, so university wasn't an option.
But I still wanted to work with animals in some far off place.
I got a job as a waitress.
I saved my wages and my tips, every penny I could to get me to Africa.
But even though I was living my childhood dream, I couldn't help but be concerned because I couldn't get close to the chimps.
I didn't know if they would ever get used to me.
And time was running out.
How frustrating was it trying to study them in those early days?
It was probably mostly frustrating because they kept running away.
And while chimpanzees are running away from you, you can't really get down to the details of their behavior and in the back of my mind it was always the fear if I don't find out something exciting.
The money will run out because all my earlier observations were either chimps close up running away, or sitting on the peak or some other spot and watching them through binoculars.
And so, from those early observations it was very clear that I wasn't really learning anything much.
I'd been in Gombe for five months.
It had been a frustrating morning.
I had tramped up and down three different valleys in search of chimps, but had found none.
I soon recognized the adult male less fearful than the others whom I already knew by sight because of the distinctive white hair on his chin.
And unlike the others, he didn't run.
After months of patient and tireless observation, I had been rewarded.
The chimps had accepted me.
And gradually I was able to penetrate further and further into a magic world that no human had explored before.
The world of the wild chimpanzees.
Finally, I was allowed to observe the chimpanzees closely.
I learned that chimpanzees spend long hours in grooming sessions.
They, like us, need friendly contact and reassurance.
As I got to know them as individuals, I named them.
David Greybeard, with his calm and dignified personality and often he was accompanied by the top ranking male at the time, Goliath.
Mr. McGregor, a somewhat belligerent old male, and then there was Flo, with her bulbous nose and ragged ears along with her infant daughter, Fifi.
Staring into the eyes of a chimpanzee, I saw a thinking, reasoning personality looking back.
I was learning from some of the most fascinating creatures of our times.
And I realized that they were all part of one group.
A community.
And the more I learned, the more I realized how like us they were in so many ways.
At that time in the early 1960's, it was held at least by many scientists that only humans had minds.
Only humans were capable of rational thought.
Fortunately, I had not been to university, and I did not know these things.
I felt very much as though I was learning about fellow beings capable of joy and sorrow, fear, and jealousy.
Louis Leakey sent me to Gombe because he believed that an understanding of chimpanzees in the wild would help him to better guess how our Stone Age ancestors may have behaved.
It had long been thought that we were the only creatures on Earth that used and made tools.
"Man, the Toolmaker" is how we were defined.
And here was David Greybeard using a tool.
It was hard for me to believe what I had seen.
A few days later, I watched spellbound as chimps set off to a termite mound, picked a small leafy twig, then stripped it of its leaves.
That was object modification.
The crude beginning of tool making.
It had never been seen before.
When I telegrammed the news to Louis Leakey he responded that "We must now redefine man or accept chimpanzee's as human."
My observations at Gombe would challenge human uniqueness and whenever that happens there is always a violent uproar.
There were some who would try to discredit my observations because I was a young, untrained girl and should, therefore, be disregarded.
The result of it all, however, was that Louis was able to obtain a grant from the National Geographic Society to continue my study.
In addition, they would be sending out a photographer to document the chimpanzees.
Hi, I'm Jane.
Hugo.
Jane, for someone who enjoyed your solitude, were you concerned about bringing another person into your... Yeah.
No, I wasn't particularly happy, but it was part of the deal.
Geographic funds you.
They must cover the research.
It was my project.
And he came to, you know, document my project.
And I just didn't want anybody coming into my little paradise.
What were your first impressions of Hugo?
Well, Hugo smoked.
He almost chain smoked.
And all the butts on the floor, and Oh, I've always hated smoking.
And he was a perfectionist.
It drove me nuts.
But at the same time, you know, he was a nice looking guy and his voice was quiet.
The first evening Hugo spent telling me about the films that he'd made and his childhood and how he'd always wanted to photograph animals.
So we had a lot in common.
And I think it was pretty obvious to me right from the start that I was a subject of interest as well as the chimps.
One day, we were greeted with fantastic news.
A chimp had crept into my tent and had taken some bananas left from my supper.
Perhaps he would come again.
And so the next day, Hugo and I waited.
As the hours went by, I began to fear that the chimp wouldn't come.
Then a black shape appeared on the other side of the clearing.
I recognized him at once.
It was David Greybeard.
I could hardly believe it.
For months the chimps had been running off when they saw me.
Now one had actually visited my camp.
After that I always had a supply of bananas ready.
The chimps often came to camp looking for bananas.
And gradually they allowed me to get closer and closer.
It was absolutely thrilling to have the chimpanzees so close, but the bananas feedings were not without problems.
As they lost their fear of us, the chimps quickly proved to be unconscionable thieves.
They would steal blankets, cloths from the kitchen, shirts and pillows, and cardboard boxes; wonderful things to chew on.
No longer did the chimpanzees arrive in small quiet parties.
Instead, they invaded our camp in huge groups and aggressive competition between chimpanzees increased.
Occasionally, we had to seek shelter.
And the aggression became more serious.
In order to stop the aggression, we decided to create the feeding station.
With the hope that it would control their aggressive tendencies and bring peace.
Now, using hand operated steel boxes, we could manage the feeding in an organized way.
As a result, we were able to make closer observations than ever before.
Old Flo was easy to identify, she had a bulbous nose and ragged ears.
Flo was the top ranked female of her community and could dominate all the other females.
But none of the adult males.
For in chimpanzee society, males are the dominant sex.
One day she came to camp with a pink swelling on her backside.
It was a sign that she was ready for mating.
Many of the males quickly realized and began their pursuit.
She was followed by a long line of suitors.
It was from Flo that I first learned that in the wild female chimps do not just have one mate.
She allowed them all to mate with her.
And Fifi hated it.
It must have been exciting to have been joined by someone who shared your passions.
No, that's right.
We both loved being out in nature and we both loved the work we were doing.
We just got on very well.
Hugo's time in Gombe was almost over.
I cared for him, and I knew that I would miss him, but then after he had left, I received a telegram.
When you and Hugo decided to get married, what were your plans?
You know honestly, we didn't make long term plans, we really didn't.
We just wanted to go back to Gombe and make films.
When we returned to Gombe, there was wonderful news.
Flo gave birth to a son.
I called him Flint.
When Flint was born, it gave Hugo and I the opportunity to initiate a study that could last 50 years.
And it was the first time an infant chimpanzee and the relationship between parent and child could be observed so closely in the wild.
As a mother, Flo was affectionate, tolerant, and nurturing and used distraction rather than punishment to teach her small infant.
Fifi soon became utterly preoccupied with her infant brother.
She tried to handle him.
But Flo very gently prevented her.
Eventually though, as soon as she was allowed she played with him, groomed him, and carried him around.
Indeed, she became a real help to her mother.
What was it about Flo that you admired?
Well, she was all things that a chimp mother should be.
She was protective, but not over protective.
She was affectionate, she was playful, but being supportive.
That was the key , and of course that is what my mother was.
She supported me.
And there's no question that those close contacts with Flo and her family were very important to my own development.
It was just so amazing to have this sort of relationship.
Together, the chimpanzees and the birds and the insects, the teeming life of the vibrant forest, formed one whole.
All part of the great mystery.
And I was part of it too.
All the time, I was getting closer to animals and nature and as a result, closer to myself and more in tune with the spiritual power that I felt all around.
I thought, as I have so often since, what an amazing privilege it was to be utterly accepted thus by a wild, free animal.
Truth is stranger than fiction and fiction can be transformed into prophecy.
Here we have a perfect example of that evolution, with this lovely English lady called Jane and likewise traded her comfortable home in England for the primitive life of the African wilderness among the African apes.
And now I give myself the rewarding pleasure of presenting to you Miss Jane Goodall.
David Graybeard is a chimpanzee who has put his complete trust in man.
Surely, it's up to us to see that, at least, some of these nearly human creatures survive in their natural habitat.
Jane Goodall living with the chimpanzees in the wilds of Africa.
I was the Geographic covergirl.
And people said well my fame was due to my legs.
Well, I mean, it was so stupid, it didn't bother me.
It was really very useful because by this time I was needing to raise money myself, so I made use of it.
Hugo and I successfully applied for additional funding, to build up a research station in Gombe.
And we accepted students so that we could take advantage of the increased opportunity for collecting data.
Jane Goodall came back from Africa just a few weeks ago.
Since then, she's been traveling around Europe and across America, telling zoologists.
It is a very great pleasure for Hugo and me to be with you here tonight.
Dr. Goodall and her husband have been filming and studying the behavior of chimpanzees.
To film her studies and they later married.
She and her husband, Baron Hugo van Lawick, are now the leading experts in the study of chimpanzees, their research station in Gombe in Tanzania.
I am absolutely full of admiration for somebody who can go and live alone in a jungle and do this sort of work that you did.
Were you ever really very frightened?
Sometimes I was frightened, especially of things like leopards, but it was the kind of life I had always dreamed of myself living.
And it was so fascinating that nothing could deter me.
What about the actual significance of the studies?
We feel quite strongly that one of the goals of continuing new work is to increasingly relate our understanding of chimpanzee behavior to human behavior.
How long are you going to be associated with the chimpanzees?
Oh I should say it's a rough guess until I die, but I can't tell you how many years that will be.
But I think one of the most valuable things has been this film record which has been kept and we are hoping that Hugo will be able to come back and carry on.
Especially as the last three months gave such fantastic film, better than all the rest put together.
It seems to me vitally important that somebody should be there.
I think the Committee would disagree that that's essential.
Hugo, would you like to say anything about the filming? The problems?
No.
Unless there's something else to discuss, we will adjourn the meeting.
Geographic ended the funding for Hugo just like that.
But it was always an assignment and assignments, when you're a cameraman, come to an end.
It was very upsetting.
Unfortunate and sad.
And it was like, well, what do we do? You know, how do we?
Because I wanted to go on at Gombe and he couldn't.
It was simple like that.
So then I had to change everything actually.
We had to find other work to do.
Which we did, of course.
On the Serengeti.
We had students at Gombe and we used to talk to them on the radio telephone just about every day, I think.
So, I would write books.
And Hugo would make films.
Was it difficult for you not to be in Gombe?
Well, because I had a jolly good team of students at Gombe and I heard what was happening all the time, it wasn't too bad at all.
I had all this finding out to do.
So, I was getting on with writing and I was able to watch other animals and that gave me a wider perspective.
I understood more animals better than if I hadn't left Gombe.
From the moment when we stood on the Serengeti plains, it had been as though an unseen hand had drawn back a curtain.
The mystery of evolution was all around us.
I was awed by the beauty.
We didn't sit down and talk about shall we have children or anything like that.
But Grub came along so, that was that.
It was just one of the things that happened.
You got married and you got pregnant, and you had a baby.
I don't remember contemplating what this would do to me, what it would do to us, how it would be, but the idea of having a baby after Flo had a baby and I thought I would watch my baby and see the difference.
And of course, Grub would be with us on the Serengeti.
I had planned to do a decent study and keep notes and everything, watching for the development stages in Grub, just as I had done with the chimps.
And capturing it on film seemed a jolly good idea, but it doesn't work with your own child.
I just found that I didn't want to do it, I wanted just to be there in the moment.
For the first three years of his life, I wasn't away one single night.
I was always there.
Of course, like all mothers, I wanted to give my son the best possible start in life, and I had to choose between various sources of advice.
There was my own mother, there was Dr. Spock, and there was Flo.
There is no doubt that my observations of the chimpanzees helped me to be a better mother.
But I found also that the experience of being myself a mother helped me better understand chimpanzee maternal behavior.
It was not until Grub came along, for example, that I began to understand the basic powerful instincts of mother love.
How much more easily I could now understand the feelings of a chimpanzee mother who furiously waved her arms and barked out threats to any who approached her infant too closely.
When Grub was little, it was dangerous for him at Gombe.
Chimpanzees eat other primates.
We are a primate.
They have been known to take infant humans.
I wasn't going to risk my little precious son.
So when we went to Gombe, it was a cage.
It had been made at a time when some of the chimps became very aggressive towards Hugo.
And so Grub sat in a cage.
But it was painted blue and there were mobiles hanging down and it was very lovely.
I had thought that I could raise a child and carry on with my work at the same time.
It was not so.
I stopped following the chimps the students and field staff did that.
I merely administered the research station.
Eventually, we spent the bulk of our time working on the Serengeti.
I was Hugo's assistant and I was mother to Grub.
From Nairobi, in a small bush plane it's a two hour flight to en Dudu Tanzania.
Our purpose was to meet Grub, the three and a half year old son of Doctor Jane Goodall and Hugo van Lawick.
Born and raised in Africa, who speaks to animals, English to his parents, and perfect Swahili to his only playmate, a 40-year-old African.
This child has spent three quarters of his life in Africa, and I don't mean in a Nairobian cities.
I mean in really remote areas.
You'll make a sound for me?
What does a zebra say, Grub?
A bit louder.
That's right. And what about a hyena?
That's a beauty. And a lion?
Tell me some stories about raising a child here, Hugo.
Well, one of the first things we had to do when he was tiny was teach him of the dangers in the bush, so we showed them to him and say, "Ow, ow,"
and teach him that he was to stay away from these animals.
Did you learn anything from watching chimps and raising children?
I'm told that a chimp baby is just given so much love.
Is that a good, do you think you could transfer that to our lives?
Does it have a meaning?
With Grub, we gave him immense amounts of love and security, and everyone said, "Oh, he'll be so dependent on you.
He'll never make his own way in the world."
It seems to myself, the opposite.
When he reaches six, Grublin will have to be taken to England for schooling.
I hope, in the process of being educated, he never forgets what he has already learned.
Any news with you? Any news with you? Over.
I just talked and I think they're coming. Over.
Okay, okay, have received you.
I'll be joining you soon.
Over and out, over and out.
It was a horrible time, one after the other.
Chimpanzees came in, dragging limbs.
Some of them were okay.
But McGregor both legs gone.
Unable to use even one arm.
It was awful.
We immediately found that we could vaccinate the chimps.
It was a bit late, but maybe it would have gone on if we hadn't.
But, McGregor he had to be shot.
Did someone say, "Let nature take its course?"
Sorry.
I didn't care what anybody said.
I was going to help the chimps if I could.
I couldn't watch an animal suffering anymore than I could watch a human suffering and not help if I could.
I see no difference between helping a human and helping an animal.
I mean, yes we could have gone on and fed him every day and kept him alive for what reason?
To be honest, if that happens to me, I do not wish to be kept alive either.
Were you ever concerned that you might've carried it in?
No.
The first examples of polio were not from our chimps.
They were way to the south, and that's where the human polio was.
So I didn't feel responsible for introducing it.
Although, for sure, it could pass on more because they were coming together.
But it didn't start with us which was very reassuring, actually.
After the incident, it was no longer permitted to touch the chimpanzees.
Gombe would never be quite the same.
I wanted nothing more than to be with the chimpanzees, and I made the decision to spend more time in Gombe.
Grub stayed with me.
So in the morning, I would do analysis of data, administration, that sort of thing.
And then I would spend about one to two hours up in a chimp camp with the students and looking at the chimps.
And then every afternoon was his, totally.
And he loved chimpanzees?
No, he did not. He hated them.
He's never loved chimpanzees.
And around him, the leaves are changing color and falling.
I tried to home school him.
"Look, Aunt Flo."
That's funny, isn't it?
"Aunt Flo."
I felt a bit isolated at that time.
-"B." -That's right.
But there were always one or two students who would come along and provide that sort of, you know, emotional support that I think sometimes is very important.
And of course Hugo was away somewhere else filming so he wasn't there to help.
I mean that was the deal, that was his work.
Flint was now an adolescent.
And old Flo... Hello, Flo.
She was now a grandmother.
Hello, Flo.
Fifi had an infant of her own.
A new generation of Flo's family to study.
But even though he was at an age when most males begin to spend time away from their mothers, Flint was still dependent on Flo.
By this time, she must've been close to 50 years old.
But Flint insisted on riding her back.
Flint was still suckling.
Flo would push him away, and he cried, and he screamed, and he got very, very clingy and very, very dependent.
She was too old to push him to independence.
You more than anyone knew the importance of socialization.
Were you concerned about Grub?
Well, Grub was school age, and I couldn't go on homeschooling him anymore.
So, it was decided that he would start school in England and live with Mom.
And I quite well remember when I had to leave him.
And how awful and betraying I felt.
But it was better for Grub.
In Christmas and Spring, I went to the UK.
In the summer, he came out to Tanzania.
Back at Gombe now, Dr. Goodall, what kind of enterprise is it today?
Well today, it's the Gombe Stream Research Center.
There are anything between six and twelve scientists working on different aspects of chimp or baboon behavior.
And there are also students studying for their PhD degrees or doing post doctoral work on specific aspects of chimp behavior, which, you know, it's quite a big little scientific community.
Flo died as she crossed the clear, fast-flowing Kokombe stream.
She looked so peaceful.
It was as if her heart had suddenly just stopped beating.
Flint sat on the bank of the stream near Flo's body.
From time to time he approached her as though begging her to groom him, to comfort him as she had always done throughout his life.
Finally, Flint moved away.
His depression worsened.
He stopped eating.
He stayed mostly alone.
And in this state of grief, he fell sick.
It was as though without his mother, he no longer had the will to live.
And about three weeks after Flo died, Flint died, too.
After the death of Flo, the chimpanzee community, whose members I had come to know so well, began to divide.
As chimps of one group started to spend more time in the southern part of the range over which the whole community roamed.
By separating themselves, it was as though they had forfeited their right to be treated as community members.
Instead, they were treated as strangers.
Our idyllic world, our little paradise, had been turned upside down.
The once peaceful seeming chimpanzees were heavily engaged in what amounted to a sort of primitive warfare.
The entire community that moved south was annihilated.
It must have been a very dark time for you.
It was a very, very dark time, it was.
I thought they were like us, but nicer than us.
I had no idea of the brutality that they can show.
Took me a while to come to terms with that.
War had always seemed to me to be a purely human behavior.
I had come to accept that the dark and evil side of human nature was deeply embedded in our genes, inherited from our ancient primate ancestors.
You and Hugo had been in different places.
Did you feel yourselves drifting apart?
Well, you do drift apart when you're in two different places and you have different goals in a way.
Hugo wasn't anymore content with just being at Gombe for me, he needed to be in the Serengeti for him.
Were you struggling to try and keep the marriage together?
Well for Grub's sake, but we'd begun bickering by then, and so you have to weigh up, you know, is it better to stay together or to subject your child to constant bickerings.
He wanted me to leave Gombe, because there was no way he could stay and work, but I couldn't.
It was my life, and he had his.
During the trying time of my divorce, it was all very sad.
Especially for Grub, for he, of course, loved us both.
But I realized that my experience in the forest had given me perspective.
In the forest, death is not hiddenm it's all around you, all the time.
A part of the endless cycle of life.
Chimpanzees are born, they grow older, they get sick, and they die.
And always there are the young ones that carry on the life of the species.
Louis Leakey sent me to Gombe with the hope that a better understanding of chimpanzee behavior might provide us with a window on our past.
Our study of the chimpanzees had helped to pinpoint not only the similarities between them and us, but also those ways in which we are most different.
Admittedly, we're not the only beings with personalities, reasoning powers, altruism, and emotions, nor are we the only beings capable of mental as well as physical suffering.
But our intellect has grown mightily in complexity since the first true men branched off from the ape men's stalk some two million years ago.
And we, and only we, have developed a sophisticated spoken language.
For the first time in evolution, a species evolved that was able to teach its young about objects and events not present, to pass on wisdom gleaned from the successes and the mistakes of the past.
With language we can ask as can no other living being, those questions about who we are and why we are here.
And this highly developed intellect means surely, that we have a responsibility towards the other life forms of our planet, whose continued existence is threatened by the thoughtless behavior of our own human species.
My life, at the time, was perfect.
I was spending time in the field.
I was writing a book.
I had students so the research was secure and I could be with my son.
It was my life for the rest of my life?
It was better than anything I dreamed of.
But I knew that the chimpanzees across Africa were disappearing.
So that's when I realized that I had to raise awareness about the plight of chimps in Africa and the role that I must play is to make sure that the next generation are better stewards than we've been.
And I needed to take that message to the world.
And since that time, that was October 1986, I haven't been more than three weeks consecutively in any one place.
When I look back over my life, it seems I've been extraordinarily lucky.
Although as my mother Vanne always says, luck was only part of the story.
She's always believed that success comes through determination and hard work and that the fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves that we are underlings.
I certainly believe that's true.
Yet though I had worked hard all my life, I must admit that the stars seemed to have played their part, too.
 That morning, the sea was rather rough.
This British convoy was detected in the mid-Atlantic... like a pin in a haystack.
We followed the convoy all day long.
And then when night came, we dived.
They were so close, we could hear the swish of the ships' propellors running right overhead.
This was it.
When the torpedo hits, it gives a bang.
That's what we have been waiting for, for days.
It was a wonderful sight.
This was a perfect job.
It's 1941.
The war is intensifying.
And Hitler is winning.
His air force is attacking Britain.
And London is burning.
German raiders last night made a two-hour attack.
Thousands of firebombs were showered down in London.
Hitler is a monster of wickedness, insatiable in his lust for blood.
British Prime Minister Churchill is begging America to intervene, but so far without success.
Your boys are not going into any foreign war.
Together, Germany, Italy and Japan, the Axis powers, seem unstoppable.
And now, Hitler moves three million troops to the Soviet border, as he starts the next phase of his plan to conquer the world.
I was a messenger.
We were summoned and each given a sealed folder.
I took mine to my lieutenant.
He opened it.
"This order is to be destroyed immediately."
He took a lighter and burned it.
It was an order to attack the next morning.
These are orders to attack the Soviet Union.
Codenamed "Operation Barbarossa,"
it will be the biggest invasion in human history.
Hitler tells his generals he wants a war against the people.
A war of annihilation.
The strength of our army, the power being unleashed, it was quite something.
Quite a spectacle.
So we were confident.
Fire!
News has suddenly burst from Europe that Germany has declared war on Russia.
Adolf Hitler's Blitzkrieg forces have been unleashed against the Soviet Union on a 2,000-mile front.
We went outside.
"Guys, that's not a thunderstorm, that's war."
This German invasion of Soviet Russia is the ultimate proof that Hitler has planned the domination of every country in the world.
Such is the hatred for Stalin's dictatorship, that in some areas the Germans are even welcomed.
Stalin, for them, was synonymous with atrocities.
Stalin let a lot of people starve to death or had them shot.
For us they weren't on the same level to German people.
It was war.
We had orders to destroy them.
Hitler's forces are now rapidly spreading across the globe.
They've reached Norway and the Arctic Circle.
They're heading towards the Middle East.
And now he's sending his favorite general, Rommel, to conquer North Africa.
It was so exciting.
We were the first German troops to go to Africa.
We were entering the unknown.
There, right on the quay... gesturing us to hurry up, was General Rommel himself.
Rommel's on a mission to drive out the British from Libya and Egypt.
For the North Africans caught in the middle, there's not much love for the British Empire.
World War II, it had nothing to do with us.
The British behaved as if they owned the country.
We hated them.
We liked the Germans, although we didn't know much about them.
Fire!
Rommel's Afrika Korps makes stunning gains.
Forcing the British out of Libya.
Rommel told us to create huge dust clouds, which we did by attaching brooms to our vehicles.
That effectively made it look like three full armies were approaching.
The German army is so confident, they act like they're on vacation.
We had such superiority.
We could safely do whatever we wanted, go wherever we wanted.
It was so easy for us.
New, severe fighting in Libya was reported by the German High Command today.
Meanwhile, the German army has been storming through Eastern Europe.
Nazis smashing towards the Russian capital have succeeded in breaking through another point.
The news from Russia continues to be grave.
The position around Kiev is critical.
We are 1,000 kilometers beyond the border.
We are facing Leningrad.
We are standing on the Black Sea.
Hitler's forces are now just 200 miles from Moscow.
And Hitler is already planning a victory parade.
The Red Army is retreating.
A million have been captured.
The Nazis feed them like animals.
What happened was ruthless.
But they were on a lower level to us.
You see, one divided Europe into three areas: Europe A, B and C.
So, Russia was Europe C, the lowest standard.
They are not civilized.
Subhuman.
That was our feeling.
The Germans are not just here to fight a war.
Hitler wants them to attack civilians too and raze villages to the ground.
We had to burn people's houses, one house after the other.
"So, I gave the order: "Pour out gas and spread some straw and set them afire."
As the war in Europe descends into barbarism, Churchill crosses the Atlantic with a desperate plea to America to intervene.
He and President Roosevelt hold a secret meeting.
They talk for four days, but Roosevelt explains his hands are tied.
Let Europe fight her own battle. They mean nothing to us.
I haven't the slightest idea of European affairs.
War? Not for me.
This time, America should keep out, and I know I will.
The American public is divided over the war.
But the president can give military aid.
He sends food and equipment across the ocean to Europe.
The job of protecting the convoys falls to the British Royal Navy, who are patrolling the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea.
My ship, HMS Barham, was like a floating city.
In battles, we feared nobody.
We were the greatest navy in the world.
Britannia ruled the waves.
David Holmes is part of a task force hunting down an enemy fleet, but what the British don't know is that they are also being hunted.
The first torpedo struck and I thought, "Don't need to worry about it."
The second one hit.
And then the third and the fourth.
Then I really knew we were in trouble.
The ship went over at such a speed.
I had to stand on the hull of the ship.
I went up, how high, I don't know.
I was checking all my limbs, to see if I've got all my limbs.
"You think to yourself, "If they can sink that ship as easy as that, what chance have we got?"
October 1941.
On the Eastern Front, winter is closing in.
The advance of Hitler's army finally begins to slow.
Their supply trucks can't get through.
Wolfgang Horn witnesses what his commander does next.
He ordered the shooting of Russian prisoners.
I heard the lieutenant calling, "This one too."
And then a shot.
I heard shots again and again and again.
It was hard.
Some soldiers came to us with a Russian prisoner.
My lieutenant gave me the order to shoot him.
We walked along a forest path.
I let him walk ahead of me.
Then I said, "Turn around."
At that time he probably assumed that his time had come.
I lowered my rifle and said... "Don't be afraid. I'm not a killer, I am a human being."
He took a step towards me and held out his hand and said, "Thank you."
"Peace be with you!"
And we parted ways.
Heinz Drossel is a rare exception.
As well as prisoners, the German army is now engaged in the mass execution of civilians.
Over a million Jewish people and other groups are murdered.
Despite the heavy snow up and down virtually the entire Eastern Front, reports here persist that German advances are still being made.
November 1941.
Reports from the East reveal that the Luftwaffe are pounding the Moscow area, hour after hour.
The Germans are 50 miles from the gates of Moscow.
The raids are the heaviest yet carried out against the Soviet capital.
Stalin has not been seen in months and the whole war seems to hang in the balance.
A meeting is called in the underground tunnels of the Moscow subway system.
Comrades!
We have a determined enemy against us.
These people have the impudence to call for the destruction of our great Russian nation.
So, from now on, our task will be to exterminate all the Germans, to the last one.
If these Germans really want a war of annihilation, they can have it.
Now, the Red Army fightback begins.
And the war is intensified further.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Japan's forces are on the attack.
They've annexed Korea.
They're in China.
And they want Hong Kong, Malaya and the Philippines... as they seek to dominate the whole of Asia.
They know there's one thing that could stop them.
The U.S. Navy.
But they have a plan for that too.
 Training started on September 18.
We had to fly low, just ten meters above the water.
We used buoys as targets.
We were training to drop torpedoes.
I knew the war had finally come, though I didn't know against who yet.
Japan has watched for months as America has debated whether to join the war.
Now their leaders decide they're not going to wait to find out.
Instead, they'll launch a surprise attack to destroy the American fleet at Pearl Harbor.
I remember that morning vividly.
The lights from the back of the planes were like a swarm of fireflies.
It was a beautiful sight.
They had no idea what we were planning, but if it was Japan's destiny to fight America, we could never meet them on a level playing field.
A surprise attack was our only option.
It was Sunday morning, and I was on third deck of the battleship Tennessee and my job was to look out.
All of a sudden, a torpedo plane flew right over our bow.
I turned to see sailors being blown into the water.
Then we were just engulfed in smoke.
Witnessing the attacks at Pearl Harbor is Harold Ward.
He calls in the news of what's happening.
So, I put on the 'phones.
A voice from out of damage control.
He says, "What's going on up there?"
So, I told him that we were being attacked by Japanese air force.
"Don't you get wise with me, Ward. I asked you a question."
So, I began to describe what I was looking at.
And there was a dead silence when I finished speaking.
"Very well. Thank you."
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, by air.
All Army and Navy bases on the island of Oahu and Hawaii... President Roosevelt said in a statement today that the Japanese have attacked the Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, from the air.
I'll repeat that.
President Roosevelt says that the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii from the air.
I saw smoke rising into the clouds.
It must have been 1,000 meters high.
Then we got a Morse code message: "Tiger, tiger, tiger!"
The mission was a success.
We were so happy!
The Japanese have tried to take out the entire Pacific Fleet.
They have sunk five battleships and three destroyers.
And killed over 2,000 people.
But they haven't destroyed it all.
 I saw the destruction the next day.
I really couldn't believe it was true.
It was a shame and a humiliation.
I realized, this is only the beginning.
Now, this has to be war.
Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by forces of the Empire of Japan.
I ask that the Congress declare a State of War.
Now, finally, America fires up its war machine.
And it will take its revenge on the Japanese.
Us Germans... Fire!
We saw ourselves as the best army in the world.
Then there was Stalingrad.
From that moment, we started to fear the worst.
As the war enters its third year, the conflict now engulfs the entire world.
The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor from the air.
Japan has bombed Pearl Harbor, dragging America into the war.
I ask that the Congress declare a state of war.
Japan has announced a formal declaration of war.
This morning's news of Japan attacks on Thailand and Hong Kong.
In the West, most of Europe is under Axis control.
The French Resistance has collapsed.
Hitler has now launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union.
The German successes against Russia can be compared to the biggest victories in the course of this war.
And now the Germans are on the march in Africa, where they have the British on the run.
So, now the stakes had never been higher.
With the Axis powers sweeping all before them, can the combined forces of the US, the Soviet Union and Britain finally stop Hitler?
Or will the Germans and the Axis powers conquer the world?
Our great heroes have history on our side.
We must crush our enemies until the final victory!
Good morning, everyone. The start of another week of war.
Down in the desert sands of Libya, everyone realizes that these are mighty serious days.
You must remember that you are in a desert, and a desert is a vast expanse of nothing.
We had a much more colorful way of describing it:
"Miles and miles and miles of sweet F-A."
Englishman Ray Ellis has been fighting the Germans in North Africa for more than a year.
Ray joined up at the start of the war, eager to do his duty.
Now, he's starting to wonder if he'll ever see home again.
I was tired of deserts and killing, and sick of the whole thing.
The excrement and bodies dying, being shot, and rotting.
Obviously, flies were there by the million.
Big, black, horrible, juicy flies.
And then there was the Germans.
The Germans were invincible.
Let's face it, nothing had stopped them.
Rommel's men are on the march again.
Rommel is a daring, skillful opponent.
The German General, Erwin Rommel, is closing in on the vital British-held port of Tobruk.
If Rommel takes Tobruk, he could take the Suez Canal.
If he takes Suez, he takes Africa.
Two officers came and said, "We've had an order, Sergeant."
"We've got to fight to the last man and the last round."
He said, "Don't think many of us are going to see the sun set today, Sergeant."
We're all in it together.
Ray's orders: Hold off Rommel's tanks.
No retreat. No surrender.
And I can remember sitting by my gun and just waiting for this battle to start.
Somebody discovered a barrel of Chianti.
Everybody was laughing and happy. It relieved all the tension.
Back slapping.
And then gradually it changed.
And it was mothers, sweethearts, and wives.
We was frightened.
All I knew was, I was spinning in the air.
I came round.
My gun was upside down.
My friends were wiped out.
I was absolutely surrounded by Germans.
I got out of my hole and then I ran.
There were two of us left.
And this man who was helping me, he was blotted.
And that was it.
I was a prisoner.
Ray is the only survivor of his section.
And he's about to be transported a thousand miles across North Africa as a prisoner of war.
And so began the most dangerous journey I've ever made in my life.
The fall of Tobruk puts all of North Africa within Hitler's reach.
Rommel inflicted considerable damage.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific, the Japanese have scored one victory after another.
The Japanese attacked defense facilities in the Philippines.
They've conquered the Philippines, Malaya and Burma.
The Japanese are closing in on Singapore from the north and west.
They're even on American soil in a remote outpost of Alaska.
The Japs have set foot in the North American continent for the first time.
We will wipe out the cruel oppression of the United States and Great Britain.
Now they're planning a surprise attack on the US fleet at the Pacific island of Midway.
Sink her aircraft carriers, and they'll knock the US out of the war for good.
There's just one problem.
The Americans have cracked their radio codes and know the Japanese are coming.
They called all the pilots for a briefing, and somehow the codebreakers knew right to the minute what the Japanese were going to do.
The morning briefing said these carriers have been picked up to the northwest, steaming in towards Midway.
We knew what the Japanese could do. We're under no delusions about that.
But we know what we can do.
We know they're coming. They don't know we're there.
Pilots, man your planes. Pilots, man your planes.
It would be the most dangerous flying I ever did in my life.
We were just coming up on a large bank of clouds.
And I had no idea exactly what we were coming up on.
I guess the best way to put it was, you're stepping into the main ring right now.
Japanese fighter pilots scramble to get airborne.
A large enemy formation in the south came across on the radio.
When I looked around, I saw 20 enemy dive bombers.
The gunfire was terrifying!
I look straight ahead of me and here comes a Zero diving in.
I squeeze the trigger.
My tracer went right into him.
The tank was hit and the plane started burning.
So I bailed out.
And I hit the water.
US pilots shoot down a dozen Japanese fighters.
I looked over to the left, and there's the biggest damn cruiser I've ever laid eyes on.
Japan's aircraft carriers are now defenseless.
The US dive bombers close in.
The first I could make out anything, I could see the bigger black blob.
I pulled up, so the first hit... Second hit.
The third hit. There must have been an inferno.
I can see it in my mind right now.
Four Japanese aircraft carriers, almost half their navy, are sent to the bottom of the Pacific.
For the first time in the war, the US has inflicted a major defeat on the Japanese.
You're walking on air.
The Japanese fleet was blunted.
It was an ambush.
An "ambush" is a dirty term anyway, but we did to the Japanese just what they'd done to us, we ambushed them.
It was wonderful.
Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the Germans have failed to land a decisive victory over Stalin's forces at Moscow.
Repeated German attacks are failing to hit Moscow's defenses.
Hitler now makes a decision that will change the course of the entire war.
Desperate for a quick win, he diverts his best army south to attack the city named after the Soviet leader... Stalingrad.
The seizure of Stalingrad will only deepen this gigantic victory, not because this place has Stalin's name, which is unimportant, but because it is a strategically vital location.
And you can be sure, nobody will drive us from this place!
We were really fired up.
Our tanks were as fast as lightning!
Our morale was sky high and we had amazing firepower.
The Germans have advanced in the last 24 hours and German reserves are continually arriving by air.
But the defenders of Stalingrad keep pouring in reinforcements.
The Soviets are outmaneuvered by the German army's speed and tactics.
But their leader, Joseph Stalin, has other cards to play.
Women of the resistance!
The whole world is looking at you as the force to destroy the German invaders.
The Red Army has recruited almost a million women.
One of them is Alexandra Bocharova.
I was told, "Girl, you're in the army now!"
"You will be a machine gunner."
"Understood?"
I liked the heavy machine gun best.
August 23rd.
Luftwaffe bombers launch the first wave of attacks on Stalingrad.
Down below, the Panzer regiments have arrived.
We came to the Volga and saw this mighty river.
We were so cocky, it was, "Great, let's shell the boats!"
I was on a boat.
A shell landed next to us.
A nurse was thrown into the water.
And she was gone to the bottom of the Volga.
Somehow we made it across.
The Germans prepare for a full-scale ground assault of the city.
We saw Stalingrad burning.
We assumed, when we take Stalingrad, the war would be over.
Fire!
We started the advance on Stalingrad.
More news of the fighting along the Russian front... The German threat of Stalingrad continues to grow daily.
We'd take a house or ditch... and they would take it back a few days later.
We suddenly realized we had a serious opponent.
Every house was a battlefield.
Shells were raining down like thunder.
We lost so many troops.
For three months, the Nazis and the Soviets fight each other to a standstill.
But the Soviets have a plan to break the deadlock.
It was a mixture of astonishment and horror.
It was like something from a movie.
The Red Army was coming, from everywhere, north and south.
Stalin has called up reinforcements, catching the Germans off-guard.
Our guns were superior.
But there were so many of them.
It was one wave after another.
They weren't getting weaker, they were getting stronger!
 We didn't care about our own lives.
All that mattered was the Motherland!
Suddenly, I saw it with my binoculars.
"My God! Stalingrad is surrounded."
While the German army is trapped at Stalingrad, in the Pacific, the Americans and the Japanese continue the battle for supremacy.
Here are the highlights in the news of the day.
The whole nation has its fingers crossed for the Navy fighting what may be one of the most crucial battles of World War II, in the Solomons area.
As we must, we are suffering losses.
But we are also inflicting losses on the enemy.
Meanwhile, in North Africa, the war turns again.
This is the BBC Home and Forces program.
Here's some excellent news, which has come during the past hour.
The Axis forces in the western desert are now in full retreat.
Winston Churchill has appointed a new commander in Africa:
General Montgomery.
And he's begun to halt the advance of Rommel's Afrika Korps.
Our mandate from the Prime Minister is to destroy the Axis forces in North Africa.
We are going to finish with Rommel once and for all.
It can be done, and it will be done.
But tens of thousands of British soldiers are still prisoners of the Axis forces.
Since being captured near Tobruk, Ray Ellis has been packed on a truck in the North African desert.
I can't remember how many days it went on.
It was a living hell.
You couldn't sit.
You couldn't move. In fact, you couldn't turn round.
Dirty, sweaty, stinking men who were emptying their bowels and their bladders as they stood.
And you were doing the same.
Many died standing up.
Until we stopped at night, when the corpses could be carried out.
Ray arrives in Italy, as a prisoner of war.
We'd been starved.
Broken-down group of men.
The street was lined with people spitting and jeering.
"This is the British army. Look at them!"
And then somewhere, out of the crowd, a young girl came and pressed into my hand a big peach.
And then ran back again and hid herself.
And I can remember eating it and holding my cupped hands round my mouth.
Don't think anything ever tasted better than that peach.
I just burst into tears.
It made me realize that when you think the whole world is against you and things are going wrong, I always think there's a girl with a peach somewhere.
It was a wonderful feeling, that... And it gave me the hope that things can change.
This is London calling in the North American service for the BBC.
 Yesterday afternoon at about 4:30, the Axis armies were cut clean in half.
November has arrived, and there's momentous news from Egypt.
The British 8th Army has defeated General Rommel's forces at the Battle of El Alamein.
Now, this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end.
But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.
And now the Americans have landed to help finish off the Axis powers in North Africa.
American paratroops and airborne infantry flown from Britain, 1,500 miles away, have landed to capture airfields, while other American troops have poured ashore on the beaches.
This is the end of the Axis African adventure.
Meanwhile, Hitler's forces on the Eastern Front are facing the possibility of a catastrophic defeat.
The German 6th Army is surrounded.
And the Russian winter is closing in.
Hitler's generals tell him the only hope is to break out and retreat.
But Hitler orders his army to stand and fight.
These last few months have been so tremendous.
Very wonderful- Let's pay tribute to the soldiers that delivered this victory.
Defeat is out of the question.
National Socialist Germany will emerge from this war with a glorious victory!
At first we thought, we're going to get out of this.
But then things got really bad.
We ran out of gas.
Then we ran out of ammunition.
Then we ran out of food, so we ate the horses.
We got orders to demolish houses for firewood.
We'd say, "Get out, we need your house!"
In one house, there was an old couple.
An old man from Stalingrad with his wife.
They had made some soup.
Something warm.
He said, "Come, eat with us."
I couldn't believe it!
Christmas Day, 1942.
Hans and his men are 1,800 miles from home and starving to death.
We had a little pine tree in my bunker.
I tried to put on a brave face for my men.
I said, "Guys, we'll get out of here somehow."
Though I didn't believe it myself.
And nobody else believed me either.
During the course of Stalingrad, my whole world collapsed.
I saw this corpse.
Some soldiers threw themselves onto him.
They cut out his heart and lungs and ate them.
I thought, my God, how low have we sunk?
The High Command of the Wehrmacht announces... The 6th Army has succumbed to the superiority of the enemy.
The battle for Stalingrad is over.
On February 2nd, the German army surrenders.
Eight hundred thousand Axis troops have been killed or captured.
A Red Army soldier shoves his gun into my chest.
And that's it, we are prisoners.
It's a disaster for Hitler and his biggest defeat of the war so far.
Then I started thinking of home.
How can we win the war now?
Sooner or later all of Germany will be surrounded like we are at Stalingrad.
That means the fall of Germany.
That cannot be.
We hugged, we kissed, and shouted, "I'm alive!"
I learned I was to receive the Order of the Red Star.
I was walking proudly!
It felt like the world was watching me.
Stalin's Red Army has stopped the Nazi tide.
But as the conflict enters its fourth year, an even harder battle is beginning.
To win the war, the Allies must take the fight to enemy territory and venture into the most dangerous place on Earth:
Nazi Germany.
The Nazis entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everybody else and nobody was going to bomb them.
They sowed the wind and now they are going to reap the whirlwind.
- Fighters at ten o'clock. - Watch 'em, Scotty.
I got my sights on 'em.
B-17 out of control at three o'clock.
Come on, you guys, get out of that plane.
I hated the Nazis, and I did want to do as much damage to them as I could, and that meant killing them, and that's all right with me.
You get a good feeling when you kill the enemy.
I always did.
And that may not sound Christian-like, or whatever, but I think men do enjoy killing under certain circumstances.
I hate to sound hardened, but it's either them or me.
This is the year 1944. Great battles lie ahead.
As the conflict enters its fifth year, the Allied leaders know that to win the war... they will have to invade Nazi-occupied Europe.
We will not stop short of our final goal, into the frontiers of Germany itself.
But Hitler has built a formidable line of defenses along the French coast.
Let the war last as long as it wants to.
Germany will never capitulate!
Churchill and Roosevelt fear an invasion could lead to a catastrophic loss of life.
But now they can wait no longer.
A massive invasion force secretly gathers in southern England.
Almighty God, our sons this day have set upon a mighty endeavor.
Lead them straight and true.
They will need thy blessings, for the enemy is strong.
We were flying out right over the invasion fleet.
And I was standing in the door.
And that was the most magnificent sight I think I've ever seen.
It looked like the whole channel was moving.
I didn't think there was that many ships in the world.
One hundred thousand Allied soldiers are crossing the English Channel.
Up ahead, Nazi-occupied France.
When we got close to the French coast, then we started getting off the ship.
The minute the boats hit the water we're thrown around like matchsticks.
And I'm Jewish.
I drew a large Star of David on the back of my field jacket with "The Bronx, New York."
And that gave me a certain bravado.
Most of the guys expected to die.
 I looked through my binoculars.
I thought I was seeing things.
There were thousands of ships that were sailing towards us.
I thought that the whole world had lined up against us.
We started to take the troops close to shore.
They gave me the job of dropping the ramp in the front of the boat.
When we got close enough to the beach, my captain says to me, "Drop the ramp."
And I froze for a few seconds.
I didn't want to die.
I pulled the handle.
These poor guys, they had no chance.
Go, go, go, go!
The water was full of blood.
Some of the guys, they were yelling, "Help me, Jesus!"
I looked over to my right.
This guy just yelling, "I'm hit! I'm hit!"
The machine gun cut him in half.
And then a shell went off in front of me.
It blew off my cheek, and I was losing a lot of blood.
Medic! Medic!
Now there are only two of us alive from my boat team.
The Germans didn't give up. They were pounding the beach.
So, we were left with options: Stay there and die or fight wounded.
We decided to fight wounded.
By the end of D-Day, the Allies' gamble has paid off.
Harold's unit has helped to secure the beachhead, and the Allies are starting to fight their way inland.
We weren't gonna give up.
The Allied armies have made successful landings in North France in history's greatest invasion.
Light airborne troops and parachutists rained down from the sky early today, while a vast armada of 4,000 ships disgorged ground troops on Hitler's fortified shore.
The Allies now have a foothold in Nazi-occupied Europe.
But they know they will have to fight all the way to the German capital, Berlin.
There's no moment now to slack, hard as it may seem after five long years of war, to bring this slaughter to an end.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific, the US Navy is forcing the Japanese back towards their homeland, island by island.
We are on the offensive all over the world, bringing the attack to our enemy.
In a series of battles, much of Japan's fleet is destroyed.
Our pilots scored the greatest aerial victory in the history of naval warfare: 402 planes to our 26.
And back in Europe, Stalin's Red Army launches a huge attack on Hitler's forces.
Tanks and fighter bombers on a scale never seen before.
Soviet units are reported nearly a hundred miles beyond the Polish frontier.
The Soviets now approach Warsaw, which has been occupied by Hitler's troops since the start of the war.
Encouraged by the Red Army's advance, the Polish Resistance rises up, liberating central Warsaw from the Nazis.
The Poles construct makeshift barricades to keep the Germans out.
They hope they can hold on until the Red Army arrives.
 We were all young, poorly armed.
It was a very dangerous situation... but we were fighting for freedom.
In a bid to fight back, Witold's unit mounts a raid on a German command post.
We were to seize the post office.
We go up the staircase.
And I can hear German voices.
I see a door... so I open it.
"Hands up! Everyone, hands up!"
The hands went up.
We grabbed all of their weapons.
Home Army units freed 50 civilian prisoners.
Thirty German soldiers were killed.
We got a great haul.
It was our first victory!
But the Germans still control most of Warsaw.
Polish Resistance fighter Bolesław Biega is one of the wounded.
 I was taken to a small hospital... and my fiancée, Lili, would come and check on me.
Then my commander says, "Why don't you get married?"
I said, "In these circumstances?"
I said, "We can get killed tomorrow, so why not?"
A messenger was sent to tell Lili, "Your wedding is tomorrow at eleven o'clock."
"Please show up!"
By chance, a passing film crew captures Bolesław and Lili's wedding ceremony.
We used curtain rings as wedding rings.
We threw a reception at the post office.
We had French sardines, cigarettes and French wine, all captured from the Germans.
Believing Soviet help is on the way, the newlyweds celebrate.
But the Red Army isn't coming.
Fire!
Stalin has decided he would rather the Nazis and the Poles fight it out between themselves.
For developments on the Western Front, Admiral takes you to Paris.
The call is this: "All to the barricades, all to the fight!"
"Parisians, forward."
Having been underground for years, the French Resistance rise up to retake the streets of Paris.
The French Resistance carrying on open warfare with the Germans, risking their lives for an ideal.
When we landed, my regiment turned right and went down through northern France.
The Germans pulled back, and we went straight on towards Paris.
Suddenly, they started to ring all the bells of the city.
I said, "Ah! What are those tanks?"
"I think they're the Allies."
Eleven weeks after D-Day, Allied troops roll into the French capital to help the Resistance.
Oh! Everybody came out and we waved.
We had waited four years. It was so long.
And we spent our day with the troops.
 I'd landed a few days after D-Day and ended up in Paris.
Oh, that was great.
You know, I sort of felt just like Queen Elizabeth.
You know, I'd ride down waving to the crowd.
Women were kissing and hugging and giving you wine and all this kind of stuff.
And I was just a kid.
We are here in Paris, which stood strong and rose to free itself of its own determination.
France, the great eternal!
For France and the Allies, it's a day of joy, but for some, it's a day of reckoning.
The afternoon of Liberation Day, we had also prepared some lists of all the collaborators we knew... all the girls who had been out with the Germans, we had all the names.
And we handed them over to the Resistance immediately.
I had a friend who ran a café.
She said, "I'll introduce you to someone."
He was handsome and single.
He was very decent and helped me survive the loneliness I had.
He was arrested.
The next day they came to find me.
The crowd was screaming at us.
They asked me, "How many Krauts?"
He said, "Get up or I'll shoot you."
"We will cut your hair. We'll shave you."
I didn't flinch. I let it happen.
I just glared back at them.
After Paris, the Allies sweep into Belgium, pushing closer to Germany every day.
We shall have to fight our way across the Rhine.
We may have to fight every inch of the way to Berlin.
But we will not stop short of our final goal.
But in the Polish capital, Warsaw, the Resistance forces are under pressure.
The Red Army has stopped on the outskirts of the city.
And the Nazis have vowed to wipe Warsaw from the map.
This is Warsaw calling.
This is Warsaw calling.
Warsaw calling.
Warsaw calling all the free nations.
Newlyweds Bolesław and Lili are in the line of fire.
Me and my wife, Lili, we were exhausted and hungry.
Our street was under siege.
There was no escape.
The Russians were on the other side of the river... but they didn't come to help.
Our fight is with the bandits who have not yet noticed that they are being abandoned by all sides.
After two months of resistance... the Poles are forced to surrender.
 Masses of prisoners went past.
They asked, "What will become of us?"
We couldn't answer them.
The SS came.
Indescribable, cruel gang.
And we heard the shots.
One hundred and 80 thousand men, women and children are massacred in the uprising.
Bolesław and Lili are among the survivors.
They're herded onto a train to Germany.
They will spend the rest of the war in a prison camp.
In the Pacific, the Americans have been continuing their island-hopping campaign, with the invasion of Saipan and Peleliu.
If they can take these islands, they will be within bombing range of the end goal: Japan itself.
Fire!
Fire!
Battle begins with an intense bombardment from the U.S. ships.
I always knew the war would come to Saipan.
You could hear the sound of the bullets whizzing past.
It was frantic, with everybody trying to take cover.
My elder brother was killed instantly.
My younger brother was injured in the head.
It is about 10:23 now, Saturday morning.
Marines have been pushing forward.
We were told that the Americans would take women as prisoners and would use us for their pleasure.
We had to avoid being captured at all costs.
The Americans sweep across the island, flushing out resistance.
Going in on Saipan, we just didn't have time to waste.
We had to get up and go.
We moved up to the tip of the island, towards the cliff.
We were told that there was women and children holed up there.
Interpreters were speaking with loudspeakers and trying to get them to give up, you know, and saying, "We'll give you food and water and take care of your sick and everybody."
Then, all of a sudden, we looked up there and they're jumping.
It was unreal.
There was nothing we could do.
We watched.
Those who remained loyal to the country would kill themselves if they were discovered.
That was their mentality.
"I think most of us felt that, "Well... you can't get them to give up, let them jump."
"Let's get this thing over with, already. Enough is enough."
Back in Europe, Germany is facing the prospect of defeat.
But Hitler is planning one last throw of the dice.
The world must know that Germany will never surrender.
I ask you to trust in my leadership... to fight fanatically through this difficult battle for the future of our people.
He gambles everything on a last-ditch attempt to split the Allied advance and drive them back to the coast.
The Americans got their asses kicked.
They weren't ready for us at all.
They ran away back into Belgium.
The Americans left everything behind them.
They even left us their breakfast.
German tanks, some of them backed up by infantry, are striking deeper into Belgium today.
The German offensive still is mounting and has not yet reached its climax.
The Germans advance 50 miles into Belgium.
This morning, the German attack continues in undiminished strength.
The situation is still grave.
The Americans rush troops to cut them off.
One of them is 20-year-old New Yorker William McBurney.
At the time, I knew I wanted to join the Air Force, and they told me they didn't have Blacks in the Air Force, but they did have a tank outfit.
I said, "Okay, that's good by me." So that was it.
Then the white soldiers cursed us out and called us all kinds of names, saying, "You don't belong up here."
I tried to block it out of my mind.
I was just proud that I was part of one of the first Black tank outfits.
It was a tight bond. Very close.
It was family.
We wanted to prove we were the best tank outfit over there.
We wanted to show them how good we were.
The weather was pretty bad today.
The ground forces need all the help they can get now, because this is a very tough fight they are in.
It was snowing.
Tanks sliding all over the road.
But we wasn't gonna chicken and run out.
We were rolling through this open field.
And this German tank came out of nowhere.
We got hit.
And so we had to get out of the tank and run.
It was a suicide mission.
Fire!
And them Germans shot everything they could throw at us, trying to kill us.
We crawled 5,000 yards in the snow.
There was Germans everywhere.
And I said, "Well, this is it. I've had it."
And Smitty said, "Man, you can't stop now. You've gotta keep going."
"You gotta get back home."
And because of him, I kept going.
Run! Run! Run!
Suddenly, the weather clears.
And Allied bombers can strike enemy positions at will.
The Germans are forced to retreat.
I saw this SS soldier. Stuck my pistol up under his chin.
And I said, "Surrender."
Well, he said, "I don't surrender to you niggers."
Yeah, now, see, if he said, "I don't surrender to you American soldiers,"
it'd have been fine with me, I'd have taken his gun.
But when he said, "I don't surrender to you niggers"
and spoke perfect English, that's when I slapped him in the mouth.
And the huge roundup of beaten Nazis left behind continues.
The prisoner count for Friday alone was almost 20,000.
As 1944 comes to a close, Hitler's armies are falling back in disarray.
Our enemies still fight fanatically, but they themselves know that they and their evil works are doomed.
American troops are moving in from north, west and south.
The road to Berlin is now open.
 Everybody is a little afraid of Berlin, but everybody wants to go there.
So many bombs fell.
We expected to die at any time.
We thought there was no way out.
Whatever our enemies inflict on German cities... I expect every German to fulfill his duties until their last drop of strength.
I see victory ahead for Germany!
The end of the Second World War is finally in sight.
1945 can see the closing in of the Nazi reign of terror in Europe and the malignant power of imperialistic Japan.
In the Pacific, American forces are pushing back the Japanese, one island at a time.
A report of a rapid advance is thrilling and exciting news.
While in Europe, the Allies have reached Germany's borders.
American First Armies advanced three miles today and are now threatening to outflank German positions guarding the Cologne plain.
But Japan and Germany show no sign of giving up.
We are fighting today to free our people from this crisis!
So, the Allies are considering just what it will take to end the war.
One bomb has more power than 20,000 tons of TNT.
It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.
After almost six years of global conflict, the war is coming home to Germany.
Carola Stern lives with her mother in a small town in northeast Germany.
Until now, they've escaped the worst of the fighting.
I remember Goebbels spoke on the radio and said, "Germany will stay German!"
"Oh, God," my mother said. "That's lucky!"
"We're saved!"
Then someone said, "German tanks are coming!"
But they were Russian tanks!
Here is the latest news on the war in Europe.
Another day of spectacular gains for the Red Army.
Marshal Zhukov is pouring thousands of tanks, guns and men inside Germany.
For Soviet platoon commander Leonid Rozenberg, the war is personal.
 The burning feeling of hatred.
My mother, my brother, little sister were shot dead by Germans.
The thing we all dreamed of was to get to Berlin!
Refugees by the thousands continue to stream from the Russian front.
 We imagine wild hordes from the east, sub-humans, and no one would get away alive.
You lose everything it means to be human.
Then there's only one thing left:
The will to survive.
Russian armies are 23 miles from the German capital, according to the enemy itself.
Adolf Hitler issued a special order calling for a stand to the death against the Soviet forces.
With the German military on its knees, Berlin's last line of defense is the Volkssturm, a rag-tag people's army made up of elderly men, women and schoolboys.
Volkssturm soldiers of Berlin, raise your right hand and repeat after me.
I vow... I vow... that I for my fatherland... that I for my fatherland... will fight bravely... will fight bravely... and would rather die... and would rather die... than give up the freedom of my people.
Than give up the freedom of my people.
Fifteen-year-old Hans Müncheberg is among the volunteers.
"I weighed 100 pounds and was 5' 3".
So, I had to roll up the trousers of my uniform.
Men of the Berlin Volkssturm, never drop the flag before the enemies of the Reich and surrender like cowards.
Hans's father is a loyal Nazi.
Now it's time for little Hans to prove himself.
My year, those born in 1929, were presented to the Führer on his birthday.
The Führer was to lead us to victory.
First, we set up roadblocks against the Red Army.
Berlin had to be defended.
We just have to hold on!
March 1945.
The Allies are pouring across the German border.
Allied armies are continuing their progress to the Rhine River with good results reported from all sectors.
Once the River Rhine is pierced, decisive victory in Europe will be nearer.
To preserve American lives, Roosevelt agrees that the final task of taking Berlin will fall to the Soviets.
We have made a good start on the road to a world of peace.
In New Mexico, scientists are developing a devastating secret weapon:
The atomic bomb.
While in the Pacific, the Americans are retaking the Philippines and the island of Iwo Jima.
We shall not rest until our enemy is completely overthrown.
Japan itself is our final goal.
One last obstacle now stands between U.S. forces and mainland Japan.
The Pacific War's greatest invasion armada has put American army troops and marines ashore on Okinawa Island.
If the Americans take Okinawa, an invasion of Japan will be within reach.
For the Japanese, it's an unthinkable prospect.
Our country had a line of Emperors 2,600 years old.
We had never been invaded by another country.
And we have the Samurai code of honor.
Japan's commanders resort to a desperate tactic to stop the U.S. fleet.
The air force calls for volunteers.
I was in the eighth special attack unit.
Hundreds of people came forward.
We believed we were doing something righteous, that it was a holy war.
I would feel brave and think we were heroes.
Next day, I would feel anxious and scared.
We didn't really believe all that "Long live the Emperor" stuff, but as a young person, you get caught up in it and feel that you have to follow suit.
One night, in the early hours, one of the guys said, "It's Friday the 13th."
So, we kind of had a feeling that something would happen.
And it did.
I was having breakfast.
One of the lookouts yelled out, "Planes overhead!"
When I saw another ship hit by a kamikaze, I thought they were crazy.
There was carnage.
I saw this plane coming in and I remember saying, "This is it, I'm going to die."
For two days, wave after wave of kamikaze suicide bombers attack the American ships.
When my turn was approaching... I was so scared of dying.
But you had to obey orders.
With the enemy fleet ahead, there was no way back.
It's a funny thing, when I knew I was going to die, I remembered things from childhood.
For example, my mother's face.
Then I was hit and blacked out.
Miraculously, after crash landing in the ocean, Kanji is thrown clear of the wreckage and picked up by a U.S. rescue boat.
But the battle for Okinawa is just beginning.
It's April, and in Europe, every day brings news of another German defeat.
The Americans captured Cologne today.
It's a city of rubble and devastation.
And right now, the German garrison is in full flight along the west bank of the Rhine.
United States forces have entered the Nazi city of Nuremberg, while Russian airborne troops have landed within 23 miles east of Berlin.
East and West have met near the German town of Torgau.
Nazi Germany has been split clean in half.
For thousands of prisoners of the Nazi regime, a moment of truth is approaching.
I was 15 when the war broke out. My friends were about the same age.
We were all young girls. Practically children.
Jewish teenager Gerda Weissmann has been held in Nazi labor camps for almost three years.
I heard planes overhead.
I remember they told us the Russian front had moved closer and the Germans, they were running away from the advancing Russian army.
We were told we were going on a march the next morning.
The SS men lifted their whips and they said, "Forward march."
We all knew that this is going to be the end of the road.
It was bitter cold.
We slept outside.
We left a bloody trail in the snow.
It was pretty brutal.
My friend said she wanted some water.
And I held her and we both fell asleep.
I woke up, but she didn't.
After a 350-mile forced march, Gerda and her fellow prisoners are locked by SS guards in an abandoned factory.
The Germans planted a time bomb to blow us up.
We tried to break out of there, and we couldn't.
I remember sitting there and really knowing that this was definitely the end.
This is The World Today.
The German resistance west of the Rhine is still crumbling and American columns are racing deep into Germany.
April 1945.
The Americans are mopping up German resistance in the west of the country.
The German army has really been cut to pieces, and they now find themselves in a parlous state.
And the Soviet Red Army has arrived at the gates of the capital.
Berlin is tonight completely surrounded by Russian armies.
I looked at the map.
Berlin was 12 kilometers away.
"I said, "Guys, for all your suffering... for all your sorrows... "fire!"
Fire!
Fire!
We gave them hell!
The infantry jumped onto the tanks.
On to Berlin!
Manning the barricades is 15-year-old Hans Müncheberg.
 I found myself in front of the Russians.
I fired in the general direction of the enemy.
It was a question of survival.
We were so angry.
Our tanks crushed the dead Germans.
And the wounded.
Revenge!
Nine of my classmates were killed.
We decided we were not going to surrender.
We would try to break out.
After two weeks of brutal street fighting, Leonid Rozenberg is among the first Red Army soldiers to reach the Reichstag, the symbolic heart of the German government, to finally avenge his murdered family.
I was ready to get to the Reichstag... and to put an end to it all.
I climbed to the Reichstag dome... and reached the victory banner.
For the entire war, I'd dreamed of reaching the enemy's lair.
I reached the lair!
The German army has been beaten.
Germany is defeated!
We came to a village.
This lady told us, "Germany has surrendered."
I said, "That's impossible. Germany can't surrender."
My captain put his arm on my shoulder.
"You know, boy, sometimes it's harder to hear the truth than a lie."
I knew it was over.
Germany has surrendered unconditionally on all fronts and to all the allies: The United States, Great Britain, Soviet Russia and France.
The Germans signed the papers at 19 minutes before three o'clock this morning, French time, in a little red schoolhouse at Reims, France.
Men and women of Germany, our Führer, Adolf Hitler, has fallen.
Here is a news flash.
The German radio has just announced that Hitler is dead.
I'll repeat that.
Hitler is dead.
Hitler has ended his own life with a bullet to the head.
He leaves behind a nation in ruins and a people shattered.
After fleeing their hometown, Carola Stern and her mother have been hiding from the Russians.
We walked until we came to a farm.
Soldiers came past and told us, "The Führer fell in the battle for Berlin."
And my mother said, "The Führer didn't know it all."
I replied, "Forget the Führer."
"He promised us the world, and now we're here in the dirt."
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.
Today is Victory in Europe Day.
As the celebrations begin, in Germany, U.S. intelligence officer Kurt Klein receives a troubling report.
We had heard of a group of Jewish women who had been dumped by their SS guards in a vacant factory building.
And because I was German speaking, I was sent in together with a jeep of medics.
A couple of days earlier, the Germans locked us into the factory and they attached a time bomb.
But it started to rain.
So, the bombing timer did not connect.
And the following morning, the doors were opened and people called and said the war was over.
A very clear view of liberation came that morning when I saw a car coming down the hill, the white star on its hood and not the swastika.
And I remember that next to the entrance of the building, I saw a girl standing.
And I decided to walk up to her.
And I asked her in German and in English whether she spoke either language, and she answered me in German.
And I said to him, "We are Jewish, you know?"
For a very long time he didn't answer me.
And then his own voice betrayed his emotion.
He said, "So am I."
I remember I said, "Oh!"
Of disbelief.
He looked like God to me.
And the impact of that, to be liberated not only by an American, but by a fellow Jew... it just, it was so totally... I mean, I think this is when that... that feeling of such an incredible joy which fills your whole being, it must have burst out.
I remember I couldn't get a hold of myself.
And then he asked a strange question.
He said, "May I see the other ladies?"
A form of address we hadn't heard for six years.
I told him that most of the girls were inside but too ill to walk.
And he said to me, "Won't you come with me?"
He held the door open for me and let me proceed him.
It's nearly impossible to describe the scene that I found inside with all these women scattered on the floor.
That was simply too overwhelming.
She pointed at them and then made sort of a sweeping gesture over this scene of devastation and said the following words:
"Noble be man, merciful and good."
And I could hardly believe that she was able to summon a poem by the German poet Goethe, called "The Divine," at such a moment.
It was a totally shattering experience for me.
Well, pretty soon trucks came, Red Cross trucks.
They took us into hospital.
I was the only one from my family who survived.
I've never forgotten the impression that this girl had made on me, and I made it my business to come back to the hospital as often as I could.
The more I talked to her, the more I realized she had something very special about her.
So, from that point on, a relationship developed.
Kurt came as often as he could, and he said, "Well, I would like you to come to America."
And I said, "Well, what would I do there?"
And he said, "For starters, you could marry me."
And that was the happiest moment of my life.
For Gerda Weissmann, there is salvation.
For millions of others, there is no way out.
The Americans have arrived in the German town of Dachau.
 We rode down a road towards Dachau.
But Dachau had no meaning for me.
There were side railroad tracks.
And we came to this enclosed place with gates and so on.
There was a huge amount of people.
There were about 30 boxcars on the railroad track, and when I looked into the cars, they were full of dead people.
I was so shocked by what I saw that it just knocked me over.
When you're in the middle of an experience of that kind, it's sort of like a nightmare.
It was beyond the realm of one's imagination.
It will take lifetimes to comprehend the enormity of the crimes committed here... and in camps all across occupied Europe, where millions have been murdered in the Nazi genocide.
In the Far East, the slaughter continues.
At Okinawa, Japan's kamikaze pilots have failed to stop the American advance.
By the end of June, after a desperate last battle, Okinawa falls.
The final goal is within sight: Tokyo.
In the Pacific, American B-29s hit Japanese installations on Honshu and Kyushu islands.
The Tokyo area is once again being pounded from the air.
Our vast task force has resumed its attacks on the enemy capital.
There is an acute realization that perhaps the hardest phase of the war is still to come.
Now, we must crush Japan.
To bring an end to the war, the Allies now face the prospect of a bloody invasion of Japan and tens of thousands more casualties.
But they've been developing a devastating secret weapon:
The atom bomb.
There can be no peace in the world until the military power of Japan is destroyed.
Only surrender can prevent the kind of ruin which they have seen come to Germany as the result of continued, useless resistance.
While American commanders debate the morality of this drastic step, some of Japan's leaders are secretly contemplating surrender.
But Japan will never have the chance to make a peace offer.
Pilot to left waist gunner. We're over the I.P.
Pilot to bombardier: Your ship.
Bomb bay doors open.
It is an atomic bomb.
The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.
There was a flash.
The blast came rushing towards us.
We were crying out to our mother.
"Mom, help us, please help us!"
I touched her with my hands.
She crumbled into pieces, and ash soared into the air.
The city of Hiroshima has been destroyed, and practically all living things were literally seared to death by the blast.
Sixty percent of the built-up area of the city had vanished, almost without trace.
A hundred thousand Japanese are killed instantly in two atomic blasts over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
A hundred and 50 thousand more will die from radiation sickness over the coming years.
Japan has surrendered.
War has ended throughout the world.
I ask you at this solemn hour to remember all who have laid down their lives and all who have endured the loss of those they love.
Congratulations for being alive and listening on this night.
Millions didn't make it.
New homecoming.
The men who tilted guns of battleships and stoked them in epic battle will ride the level ferries of bay and river.
The pilot with many missions will do errands for some civilian company.
And tank men will drive a powered lawnmower while their fathers watch.
After six years of all-out war, the world counts the cost.
More than 60 million are dead.
Those who have lived through this conflict will carry the scars forever.
It will fall to those who come after to learn its lessons.
A couple of Nazi war criminals, Goering and Von Rundstedt, both of them big fish, they've been caught and they've been brought to Britain now.
They will be tried in London for their war crimes.
The American request for opening up Palestine to Jewish refugees would be granted through agreement with the British government.
But the initial indications were that neither Arabs nor Jews were going to be satisfied with it.
We've got to prepare a climate for peace, a climate of understanding and goodwill.
A Human Rights Commission is expected to draft a Bill of Rights for all mankind that would serve as the conscience of the United Nations.
Sail on, O ship of state.
Sail on, O union, strong and great!
Humanity with all its fears, with all the hopes for future years, is hanging breathless on thy fate!
The biggest living thing that exists on this planet is a plant like this giant sequoia tree in California.
Plants, whether they are enormous, like this one, or microscopic, are the basis of all life, including ourselves.
We depend upon them for every mouthful of food that we eat ﻿and every lung full of air that we breathe.
Plants flourish in remarkable ways, yet, for the most part, the secrets of their world have been hidden from us until now.
Now we have new ground-breaking technology that enables us to enter their extraordinary world and see their lives from their perspective.
This series will reveal the extraordinary and dramatic ways in which plants behave and we will explore the challenges demanded by the very different landscapes in which they live.
The tropics.
The richest and most competitive place in which to survive.
The bizarre water world where giants fight ferocious battles, and plants eat animals alive.
Seasonal lands where survival depends on precision timing.
And everywhere, we will explore the critical and intimate relationships between plants and animals, including ourselves.
Join me in a world that takes you by surprise and see our planet as never before from the plants' perspective.
This is The Green Planet.
I'm in Costa Rica, in the heart of a rainforest, the richest and most dynamic environment on Earth.
Rainforests only cover a very small proportion of the Earth's surface, yet they contain over half of all known species of animals and plants.
Up here, the forest's canopy is bathed by life-giving sunlight.
The branches of the great trees ﻿carry rich, flourishing sky gardens home to countless different kinds of beautiful plants.
Each species has evolved its own exquisite solution to the challenges of survival.
This forest world may look peaceful, timeless and unchanging, but that is far from the truth.
This is a battlefield.
Throughout this forest, plants are competing ferociously with one another to claim the light.
The battle is at its fiercest on the forest floor where only 2% of the sunlight filters through.
Plants here have to bide their time.
Their opportunity comes when an old tree dies.
When that happens, sunlight floods the forest floor ﻿for the first time in perhaps 100 years.
The seedling's wait is over.
It must now race skywards and claim a place in the canopy.
But it's not alone.
Rivals are everywhere, each with its own survival strategy.
﻿Some plants, like this monstera, ﻿stretch out divided leaves to collect what light they can.
This vine is groping blindly around with its tendrils.
It attempts to reach the light by hitching a ride.
Its tendrils are highly sensitive to touch.
And a suitable target is in range.
The vine tightens its grip and begins to haul itself upwards.
But it's now overtaken by the forest's fastest-growing tree.
A young balsa.
Its giant leaves are already 40cm across and are stealing the light from its rivals below.
But the balsa's battle is not yet won.
Other, different vines are lying in wait.
Each is armed with dozens of claw-like hooks.
If just one hook gets a grip, the vine will be able to smother its victim.
But the balsa is defended by a shield of slippery hairs.
The vine's hooks just can't get a hold.
The balsa brushes them aside and continues to rush skywards leaving the losers in its shadow ﻿to fight among themselves.
This balsa has won its battle for the light.
And it's done so in a little over a year.
Most trees would have grown an inch or so in that time, but this one is already 30 feet - 10 metres - tall.
Balsas owe their success to the special character of their wood.
If this section of tree trunk came from a hardwood tree, ﻿it would be really quite heavy.
But as it is, it's from balsa, and it's really very light, ﻿and that's because of its internal structure.
Under the microscope, balsawood looks like a honeycomb.
It contains more air than wood, so, not only can it grow very fast, but it gets the maximum height for minimum weight.
But fast growth needs something else.
Fuel and lots of it.
That fuel is created in a plant's leaves, as they soak up the sun.
It's a process called photosynthesis a chemical reaction that is the basis of all life on Earth.
﻿Leaves are covered by thousands of microscopic pores called stomata.
When open, they extract carbon dioxide from the air, ﻿and, using energy from the sun, combine it with nutrients to build the plant's tissues.
And critically for us, the process releases the oxygen that we and all animals need in order to breathe.
But for plants, there is a downside.
﻿These precious, energy-packed leaves attract predators in every shape size and agility.
A sloth can only move slowly, but you don't need speed to gather leaves, and it eats nothing else.
The plants here are under constant attack from all kinds of leaf-eaters, but the most voracious by far is hardly ever seen.
It consumes 50,000 leaves every day.
It's created this great clearing in the forest and it lives just beneath my feet.
It's called leucoagaricus.
It's neither animal nor plant.
It's a fungus.
It lives five metres underground, far from the leaves that it devours.
To get them, it employs the best leaf-gatherers in the tropics.
Leafcutter ants.
Millions of them provide the fungus with its food, and in return, the fungus cultivates tiny mushrooms as food for the ants.
The fungus releases chemical signals that tell the worker ants what type of leaf it wants to eat.
Scouts are sent out with the latest orders.
Worker ants will travel hundreds of metres to find the right kind.
Today's crop is being taken from a young bixa tree.
Just a few years old and still battling to reach the canopy, it can ill afford to lose any of its leaves.
Between them, the ants can demolish a large leaf in a matter of minutes.
The sound of cutting attracts more ants.
Now the pieces are carried back to the underground fungus.
The ants can run at speeds of two metres a minute.
And each can carry a load ten times its own weight.
It's a river of leaves across the jungle floor part of a vast network that extends for miles through the forest.
To avoid congestion, worker ants dig trenches around obstacles.
Thousands of pieces are delivered every hour to the waiting fungus.
Fed by such a continuous supply, the fungus grows rapidly, filling the chambers in which it lives so, the ants excavate more space.
It seems that the fungus has the upper hand and the bixa tree will not survive.
But it fights back using chemical warfare.
The bixa tree floods its leaves with toxins that could kill the distant fungus.
As the ants carry the fragments back, they are themselves poisoning the fungus on the tree's behalf.
It's a long-distance attack.
As the poison takes effect, the ants sense that their fungus is weakening and they respond to its signals by changing to another source of leaves.
So, the plant's chemical response forces the ants to constantly switch from tree to tree.
Strike and counterstrike.
And that ensures that enough leaves remain uneaten for each tree to recover.
Once a plant becomes adult, it can switch its energies from growth to reproduction.
The tropical forests of the Americas stretch from Mexico to the southern reaches of the Amazon.
They contain more than 100,000 different species of plants, each with its own particular survival strategy.
One species that has adopted a grow-fast lifestyle flourishes throughout this vast region.
The balsa.
But it has to pay a high price for doing so.
The lightweight wood that enables it to grow at such speed is not strong and is easily broken.
Few balsas live longer than 20 years.
This one is approaching the end of its brief life, so, the time has come for it to reproduce.
It has used a huge amount of energy to produce some of the most extravagant flowers in the forest, in immense numbers.
Each is the size of a human hand.
As night falls, the tree prepares an enticing treat.
This is a kinkajou, a kind of fruit-eating racoon.
Each flower is filled with huge quantities of exceptionally rich nectar, supercharged with sugar.
Irresistible!
The kinkajous drink so greedily that they get pollen all over their faces.
So, as they move from tree to tree, they carry pollen with them.
But the balsa leaves little to chance.
The nectar might appear to have run out, but this is just the first round.
Now the balsa refills its flowers, enticing the kinkajous back to repeat the process seven times a night.
Pollination is complete.
And the kinkajous - they also get well served, with over 100 pints of nectar in just a few weeks.
Both plant and animal do well out of this arrangement.
But in the tropical world, that isn't always so.
Borneo.
Here, on the slopes of Mount Kinabalu, live plants that eat animals using pitcher-shaped leaves full of water.
Insects are attracted by the expectation of nectar, but tumble into the pitcher, where they are drowned and absorbed.
On the lower slopes of the mountain, a plant grows that has no leaves at all.
Or even a stem.
All that can be seen is this a bud.
It is a parasite.
The rest of its body lies within the tissues of a liana, on which it feeds.
After about five years, the bud finally opens into a monstrous flower.
It now has only a day or so in which to be pollinated before it starts to wither.
Its petals are the colour of blood.
Their surface is tough and warty.
It appears to have fur.
Even whiskers and teeth.
At first sight, it might be mistaken for a dead animal.
This is rafflesia, the corpse flower.
A metre across, it's the world's biggest flower.
And this one is a male.
From its centre comes the pungent odour of death.
It's a scent that might not appeal to every animal.
But it's very attractive to carrion flies.
They lay their eggs on rotting flesh.
The scent lures the fly deep into the flower in search of meat.
The fly finds nothing.
The rafflesia, however, has the fly exactly where it wants it.
It's stuck pollen to the fly's back.
If this male rafflesia's strategy is to work, the fly carrying its pollen must now visit a female corpse flower such as this one.
Success!
Once pollinated, plants are able to produce seeds, the next generation, but once again, there are animals all over the forest that are eager to make a meal of them.
The Malay Archipelago, ﻿a vast tropical world of 1,000 islands.
It's home to giants the tallest trees in the tropics, many of which live for centuries.
They produce seeds in enormous numbers, but only do so when the time is right.
This individual hasn't produced a single seed for nearly a decade, but in the last weeks, it has become festooned with more than 10,000 of them.
﻿Each seed has the potential to produce a giant, like its parent.
But success will depend on timing.
Seed-hunters are gathering.
Bearded pigs.
But these seeds have been produced by a dipterocarp trees that create the tropical world's largest seed nursery.
After years of waiting, ﻿thousands upon thousands of individual dipterocarps have synchronised to produce the next generation, all at exactly the same time.
And now these seeds will face the dangers below together.
By releasing billions of seeds all at the same time, they swamp the pigs and any other animals with more than they could possibly eat.
And that buys time for some of the seeds to take root and sprout.
The tree's strategy has worked.
But a seedling will have to overcome many more dangers over the years if it, too, is to become a giant.
And there are many ways in a tropical forest by which a tree's life can be ended before it reaches its prime.
The northernmost tip of Australia.
This is the world's most ancient rainforest.
﻿Battles between animals and plants have raged here for 180 million years.
So, the plants have had time to develop effective defences.
This is a poison arrow tree, one of the tropical world's most heavily defended plants.
Its trunk is tall and slippery ﻿and exudes a poisonous sap.
It appears to be almost invulnerable.
But even so, just as this individual reaches maturity, its life has become endangered.
Each monsoon season, it is invaded from above.
It attracts hundreds of shining starlings.
Its immense smooth trunk makes its high branches above a safe place to nest, but over the years, this has created a major problem for the tree.
After feeding, the starlings return to the nest to digest their food, with inevitable consequences.
Every year,they produce almost a quarter of a ton of droppings.
The toxic chemicals they contain create a dead zone that completely surrounds the tree.
The toxins are absorbed by its roots and travel up through the trunk and into every leaf.
Branch by branch, the tree is slowly dying.
It has become a victim of its own success.
It has been poisoned.
Now a new battle begins one to claim the tree's dead body and the vast amount of nutrients that it contains.
It's a battle that is fought throughout the natural world involving a group of organisms that we rarely notice.
Here, on the floor of a tropical rainforest, it's dark, it's humid and it's hot ideal conditions for fungi.
We normally think of fungi as things like this.
Mushrooms of one kind or another.
But these are just the fruiting bodies.
They exist for most of the time hidden in the leaf litter and the earth as a network of fine white threads.
The threads of competing fungi envelop their victim's body, releasing enzymes which digest the tree's tissues and unlock the nutrients within.
There a million or so different species of fungi in the tropics.
Some feed on dead plants.
Others eat them alive.
And some reveal their existence in an eerily beautiful way.
﻿In Africa, in the Congo, this is known as chimpanzee fire.
The mysterious bioluminescent glow becomes brighter as the fungus digests the tree.
When fungi have fed sufficiently, ﻿they develop their reproductive organs.
Each can produce literally billions of spores the tiny particles that carry the species' genetic blueprint.
Each spore like this has the potential to kill a tree.
The spores are so light they can be carried by the slightest air currents.
At least a billion float above every square metre of rainforest.
Recently, it has been discovered that these spores do far more than just bring death and decay.
They are, in fact, at the very centre of the rainforest's life support system.
High in the humid air, the spores combine with molecules of water.
Gradually, they collect into droplets, which, when they are heavy enough, fall as rain.
Over two-and-a-half metres of rain falls every year in a rainforest.
And in the centre of almost every raindrop, there is a fungal spore.
The world's rainforests are the richest and most dynamic environments on Earth, built on complex connections and relationships.
But these connections, competitive or collaborative, are now becoming increasingly fragile.
When Charles Darwin was exploring the tropical world nearly 200 years ago, he wrote this in his diary.
Among the scenes which are deeply impressed on my mind, none exceed in sublimity the primeval forests undefaced by the hand of man.
He would struggle to find such a place today.
Today, 70% of all the world's rainforest plants grow within a mile of a road or a clearing that we have cut into the forest and this is creating new battlefields in the tropical world.
Alien armies of identical cultivated plants now stand where thousands of different species once grew.
﻿We have planted vast regiments of crops in order to provide ourselves with food and other commodities and the ancient forest has been reduced to ever fewer isolated fragments.
All, however, is not lost.
The fragments can still be sanctuaries, keeping alive the intimate relationships within them.
Their size is nonetheless critical.
This is the seven-hour flower.
This plant produces its flowers at night.
They open about six o'clock, and each blossom only lasts that night.
﻿It opens for about seven hours and then it dies.
But during that time, it provides food for one particular animal.
A bat.
And here it is!
During the seven-hour flower's flowering season Underwood's bat feeds almost exclusively on its nectar.
It is the plant's primary pollinator.
It might seem that this is a fairly evenly balanced relationship, but not so.
The bat likes this nectar because it's sweet, but it's not very nourishing.
So the bat must visit hundreds of flowers a night and it pollinates them as if feeds.
But if a patch of forest becomes too small, with too few flowers, the bats will disappear, and without the bats, the flowers can't reproduce and will soon die out.
The partnership is broken.
Life in the forest depends on countless close relationships, but they are increasingly under threat as forests become more fragmented.
The solution, of course, is to join these remaining fragments together again.
30 years ago, I came to this exact spot.
﻿This land belonged to a scientific research establishment and it was covered with grass being grazed by cattle.
The scientists got rid of the cattle ﻿and allowed nature to take its course.
Just look at it now!
This new forest has become a bridge that connects several fragments, allowing plants and animals to both renew old connections and create fresh ones.
Of course, we urgently need to protect what healthy forests still remain.
But looking forward, we must take what may well be our last chance to re-establish the lost rainforest and help the tropical world to heal itself.
It will take the co-operation of nations around the world, but it is the only way in which we'll be able to preserve the treasures of the tropical rainforest for future generations.
And with it, ultimately protect all life on this, our green planet.
The aim of The Green Planet team was to take the viewer into the world of plants, so that it could be seen from the plants' perspective in a way that had not been possible till now.
That meant developing an entirely new camera system.
And this is the game-changer ﻿a specially designed robot camera that we affectionately call "the Triffid".
The Triffid started life in the garage of an American ex-military engineer, Chris Field.
I'd seen quite a few of these Planet Earth style documentaries, and they always absolutely blew my mind, especially the botanic time-lapse really spoke to me.
In his spare time, Chris spent a decade building elaborate motion-controlled time-lapse camera rigs and teaching himself how to film plants.
Plants often behave like animals in so many ways, and being able to see it through time-lapse is one thing but using the motion-control brings you into that timescale.
We could really see the potential in how we could use this sort of movement to bring plants alive and film them in the same way that we film animals.
Soon, Chris joins the team in a quiet corner of the Devon countryside and the robot army begins to take shape.
After 40 years of filming time-lapse, these rigs have opened up a whole new world for us.
So, it'll be like hovering around something with a drone or helicopter, but in a time-lapse speed.
The holy grail for us is being able to take this technology out into the wild, try and get the same sorts of dynamic moves in some of the most extreme environments in the world.
So, what we needed to do was to develop this technology even further.
Six months later, the Triffid is born and with slight trepidation, they hand me the controls.
That makes it go away.
﻿And this makes it come back.
And this sends it up.
I think I'd better hand it over to the experts.
Now it's time to put this new member of the team properly through its paces.
The aim here is for Ollie to find a target, aim for it and fly through it, as if he is a tiny fly going through a hole in a leaf.
Easier said than done.
I'm trying to find a target.
Whether the kit's going to stand up to that sort of use and the abuse that we throw at most pieces of kit has yet to be seen.
In the studio, it seems to be working pretty well.
But this is only a dress rehearsal.
﻿It's time for the Triffid to face the challenges ﻿of the Costa Rican rainforest, and leafcutter ants.
We want to film their journey all the way down the trunk and along this buttress root and down to their nest.
The team and the Triffid need several days of dry weather, but a storm can hit at any moment and rain is one thing the Triffid does not like.
The conditions that we're working in now are a little bit more challenging than the studio.
All the ground is really bumpy.
We've got loads of plants in the way.
I know we're making a series about plants, but sometimes they're a complete pain in the neck!
The Triffid needs to be programmed to capture images from 7,000 different camera positions on the ants' trail.
Just one drop of rain on the lens, or a wobble, and the whole process will have to start again.
I think this is when we're going to find out if our ambition outweighs our ability.
For the crew, the ambition is certainly high.
Fortunately, it's all down to the Triffid now.
We've been filming the ants with the Triffid for eight days now, and we're on our third set-up.
It's pretty slow going.
While the Triffid seems to be handling the pressure well, ﻿for the crew, trying to take a tree's-eye view of ants is turning into a bit of a nightmare.
Wake up, film ants, go to sleep, dream of ants.
Wake up, film ants, sleep, dream of ants.
Wake up, film ants, go to sleep, dream of ants.
After two weeks in the jungle, ambition and ability finally come together, for the Triffid, at least.
Thousands of individual images creating a single extraordinary time-lapse one that follows a river of leaves across the jungle floor from a unique perspective.
For the Triffid, this was just the beginning.
Take a bow, Triffid.
Next time on The Green Planet the wonder of water worlds where plants hunt go on the move fight and create the air we breathe.
The Open University have produced a poster that explores the vital role that plants have for our planet.

Plants cover much of the land surface of our planet.
But there is another extraordinary green world that is often hidden from us.
It's one where plants have overcome huge challenges in order to survive.
The world of fresh water.
At first sight, a lake like this would seem to have everything that life needs in order to thrive.
Clear, oxygen-rich water, plenty of dissolved nutrients and minerals and lots of sunlight.
But, in fact, life in fresh water presents plants with huge problems.
To succeed, plants have had to abandon many of the adaptations that served them so well on land and evolve something quite new and, doing that, they have created some of the most beautiful and bizarre and important habitats on Earth.
There are few places where it's more difficult to make a permanent home than a freshwater torrent like this one.
Violent currents drip across the riverbed, scouring it clean whipping land plants from their margins and drowning them.
How could any plant survive in a place like this?
Yet, even here, some do manage to, quite literally, hold on.
They can grasp the bare rock with remarkable strength.
This ability allows plants to thrive in these otherwise hostile environments.
This is the Cano Cristales river in Colombia.
These plants are red Macarenia, sometimes called the Orchid of the Falls.
They cling to the riverbed, not with their roots, but with their stems, glued to the rock surface by one of the most powerful adhesives in nature.
The rock itself will break before these anchors lose their grip.
These feathery filaments are their modified leaves, and they do what roots normally do gather the minerals and nutrients they need that are dissolved in the water.
With such spectacular colours, it's hardly surprising that the Cano Cristales is sometimes called the most beautiful river on Earth.
But being rooted to the spot is not always the best strategy for living in a water world.
This is a water lettuce, and it has some remarkable adaptations.
Its roots hang free, so it's not anchored to the ground, and its leaves are thick and spongy and covered in fine hairs.
So the plant itself is more or less unsinkable.
This combination of characteristics enable the water lettuce to do something that almost no land plant can do.
It is an ability that becomes invaluable when, during the wet season, flooded rivers become great highways, as they do here in South America.
This is the largest inland water world on Earth.
The Pantanal.
For a few months every year, it provides water plants with ideal conditions, but, all too soon, it becomes a battleground.
Plants are racing to claim their space on the surface.
The water lettuce rapidly expands its network of hanging roots so that it starts absorbing nutrients before other competitors arrive.
Water hyacinth appears.
Its leaves are carried on stalks filled with air that also make it virtually unsinkable.
The race for space intensifies.
A new competitor arrives, Ludwigia.
It spreads by developing a chain of tiny rafts.
And jostles for space with the densely packed leaves of mosaic plants.
All are racing to claim as much sunlight as possible.
They flower quickly before the floodwaters recede.
And these surface dwellers also have competitors.
Including one that has been waiting in the depths and is now stirring.
It's a monster.
It's well armed.
It clears space for itself by wielding one of its buds.
Like a club.
And now it dominates the surface.
This is a leaf of the giant water lily.
It expands by over 20 centimetres a day and eventually measures more than two metres across.
Its immense leaves are supported by a network of air-filled struts and protected by spines two centimetres long.
The leaves float high in the water and their surfaces are dotted with tiny holes, drains, that help them ensure that rainwater doesn't accumulate and sink them.
Nutrients from the fertile mud below are carried up by tubes in its stem to fuel the leaf's expansion.
Over the next few months, the lily will produce some 40 or so of these gigantic leaves.
And as each one reaches the surface and expands, more and more light is taken from those plants that are trying to grow beneath.
Competitors are pushed aside.
Some are crushed, or skewered.
Eventually, its immense leaves press their margins against one another, totally cutting off the light from the plants beneath them.
The battle is over.
And victory is total.
The frozen water world of Lake Akan in northern Japan.
Home to one of the strangest and most primitive of plants.
It's an alga, like those that appear so mysteriously in our ponds.
But this one is truly extraordinary.
Each spring, the melting ice releases soft, velvety balls of interwoven threads called Marimos.
This one is small.
No bigger than a walnut.
But there are lots of them here.
They attract the attention of visiting whooper swans.
But there is one way for the Marimo to escape from the danger, and it depends on a change in the weather.
Fortunately, in the spring, winds sweep across the lake creating currents that carry some of the Marimos beyond the reach of hungry swans.
It's the start of a remarkable journey.
They are gently carried back and forth by the currents so that the Marimos become more and more spherical.
And, slowly, they travel into deeper water.
Here, there are great numbers of them, certainly many millions.
Some are the size of basketballs.
They're safe from swans, and the water is still shallow enough for some sunlight to reach them.
It seems a perfect home.
The snag is that these waters also carry a fine sediment that can clog the Marimo's surface, cutting off the all-important light.
But the Marimos are not entirely immobile.
They dance.
The winds blowing over the lake's surface create currents beneath that are sufficiently strong to move the Marimos.
They rub against each other.
And in just a couple of hours of gentle movement, they're all clean once more.
As they spin, every part of their surface gets enough time in the sunlight to keep growing.
This is the heart of the Amazon.
There are water worlds here that are so remote that, even today, few people have ever seen them.
This barely explored tributary is the Rio Claro.
And here, when conditions are just right, it's possible to witness a rare and remarkable spectacle.
The river is so crystal clear that its bed is bathed in sunlight.
A magical landscape of miniature mountains and valleys.
It's carpeted by pipewort, fanwort and star grasses.
As the sun climbs in the sky bubbles of gas appear.
Evidence of photosynthesis.
Deep inside the plant cells, tiny structures called chloroplasts move towards the light.
They absorb carbon dioxide and use the sun's power to synthesise the sugars that the plant needs to grow.
And as a by-product, they release oxygen.
The gas that we and all other animals must have in order to breathe.
Now, in late afternoon, bubbles of oxygen make the river water fizz like champagne.
The plants can become so buoyant with gas that they rise to the surface, even carrying the bedrock with them.
Only in this remote water world can this spectacular natural wonder be seen.
Eastern Venezuela.
Here, rectangular table mountains known as tepuis stand above the tropical forest.
There are more than 50 such isolated mountain plateaus here, each home to a unique community of plants.
Downpours are so torrential that no soil can accumulate on their broad, rocky summits, and some plants living up here have to find their nutrients from another source.
These are Bromeliads.
Their leaves are shaped like a funnel and collect rainwater, which accumulates in the centre.
This small pond is colonised by all kinds of tiny animals.
And it is their bodies, when they die, that provide some of the nutrients the Bromeliads need.
This makes a good partnership in which both parties can thrive.
But it can be exploited by a plant predator.
This probing stem belongs to a plant called a bladderwort.
It, too, is in need of nutrients.
And a well-stocked Bromeliad pool is just the place to find them.
This one is full of aquatic animals.
The bladderwort begins to change into a hunter.
It develops bladders and removes sufficient of the water within them to create a partial vacuum.
Each bladder has a trap door beside it with trigger hairs.
Now all the bladderwort has to do is to bide its time.
It only takes one touch for the trap door to snap open and suck in its prey.
It's all over in a millisecond.
And after it has fed, a bladderwort has enough energy to produce another tendril to search for another Bromeliad pool.
Swamps and bogs are also poor in nutrients.
So several plants that live in such places catch insects too, if they can.
The leaves of Sundews are covered with long, red hairs, each tipped with a droplet.
These glistening globules are, in fact, glue.
Once the Sundews detect the taste of their victim's body, they flood it with digestive enzymes.
The little body disintegrates.
And the Sundew gets the nutrients it needs.
Another plant has an even more elaborate way of catching a meal.
The Venus Flytrap has leaves that are lined with interlocking teeth.
It attracts insects by producing a sweet perfume, just as a flower does.
It, too, has a hair trigger.
And another insect is caught.
But the technique is more complex than it might seem.
The Venus Flytrap has a problem.
It needs to avoid false alarms, snapping shut on something inedible, like a raindrop or a little bit of twig.
That would be a waste of both time and energy.
So how does it avoid that?
Well, it does it by counting.
If I touch this one, sensitive hair just there no reaction.
That could be a false alarm, but the plant remembers that for 20 seconds.
And if I touch it a second time within that time, then that's much more likely to be worth eating.
And so it closes.
So far, so good, but now it needs to be absolutely certain that it's got something worth eating, so it continues counting.
Only after it has totted up five separate touches to those hairs will it give the final squeeze and then begin to produce the liquid from the surface of the leaf, which will dissolve the body of its unfortunate victim.
The Flytrap now has enough energy to produce flowers and attract pollinating insects.
Wind and insects between them pollinate virtually all land plants, but neither method can be used by plants that live entirely underwater.
So some lead double lives.
A chalk stream in southern England, and swaying in the current is a plant for which these rivers are famous.
This is water-crowfoot, a kind of aquatic buttercup.
For most of the year, it is underwater.
And if I take this underwater camera you can see its floppy stems grow horizontally.
That reduces the risk of being swept away by the current.
But each spring, when it's time to flower, it produces something crucially different a stem that is stiff enough to resist the current and lift its flowers into the air above.
And now, of course, they can get help from insects.
So every year, in part, at least, water-crowfoot becomes a land plant and provides us with one of the loveliest natural spectacles of the early English summer.
Water-crowfoot is not the only water plant to lift its flowers above the surface.
Plants do so all around the world.
From the swamps of the Pantanal to the lakes of Thailand, they all burst into spectacular bloom.
Once they've been pollinated, they produce seeds.
And now their flowers have done their job, some return to a life under water.
Now they must ensure that some of their seeds will find suitable places in which to germinate.
Bullrushes every year produce these long, brown, velvety objects.
Look what happens when I break one open.
It contains almost a quarter of a million seeds.
Each seed is attached to a delicate parachute.
Even the slightest breeze will lift it and may carry it for very long distances indeed.
So even though suitable stretches of fresh water are few and far between, there's a good chance that at least one will end up in a place where it can grow.
Much bigger seeds, of course, can't travel by air.
A river can provide transport, but it's a one-way journey downstream that often ends up in the sea.
And that's not ideal.
So how can any riverside plant avoid this and travel upstream?
Here, along the Bonito River in Brazil, a variety of trees manage to do exactly that.
They embed their seeds in the middle of soft, sweet fruit.
Monkeys, such as these capuchins, make a meal of them just as soon as they're ripe.
But monkeys are very wasteful feeders.
And what's not eaten ends up in the river and is washed away.
But not all.
In the fruiting season, hundreds of Piraputanga fish gather beneath these trees.
But the Piraputanga want more than the monkeys' leftovers.
The brightly coloured fruits are clearly visible, even to the fish in the water below.
And some manage to claim them even before a monkey does.
This isn't a skill mastered by just one particularly successful acrobatic fish.
Many of the Piraputanga can do this.
Nor is this a disaster for the tree.
These Piraputanga are migratory, heading many miles upriver to spawn.
The trees, by enticing the fish to eat their fruits, have a perfect means of transport for their seeds.
With luck, the seeds will be deposited many miles upstream.
The ability to colonise new habitats has allowed one group of flowering plants to venture out of fresh water and into a world that may look the same to us, but for a plant is crucially different.
The much greater, saltier world the sea.
This is a fruit from one of the most important plants on the Earth today.
Seagrass.
This particular one is floating off the coast of Formentera in the Mediterranean.
100,000 years ago, a seagrass seed like this sank to the sea floor just here.
And, eventually, it produced a great meadow.
A meadow that is still flourishing today.
It did so by cloning itself.
Now over ten miles across, it's not only one of the largest living organisms on Earth, it's also one of the oldest.
And it supports a rich community of many kinds of animals.
It's become a kind of marine savannah.
Over 1,000 species now live here.
Some, like these elegantly camouflaged pipe fish, live nowhere else but amongst the seagrass.
Seagrass fringes many of the world's coasts.
Turtles depend upon it, too.
And so do Dugong - animals that are sometimes called, very appropriately, sea cows.
Today, seagrass plays a critical role in maintaining the health of our planet.
It creates stores of carbon around its roots at an enormous rate.
35 times faster, in fact, than plants that live on the floor of a tropical rainforest.
Here in Formentera, it's possible to see, beneath the living seagrass, layer upon layer of trapped carbon that the plants have accumulated over the past 2,000 years.
Seagrass, however, is easily destroyed by human disturbance.
A third of the world's underwater meadows have already been lost, and many more are in decline.
Biologists are now striving to not only protect the remaining meadows, but to restore them.
One plant at a time.
Seagrass could be a valuable ally in our fight against climate change.
Today, water worlds everywhere are under threat.
Many of their inhabitants are disappearing without us even being aware of their existence.
The plants that grow in water are probably the least noticeable.
They're certainly the least studied.
But the more you know about the problems of living in that way, the greater the wonder of their success.
Surely they deserve more of our attention and, most importantly, our care.
This vast wetland is the Pantanal.
The Water World's team are heading to a plant battlefield.
The home of Brazil's giant water lily.
This is like seeing the end of a war.
There are leaves growing on top of each other, flowers going through leaves.
Unbelievable!
To capture this story in all its detail would take over a year and require a unique Green Planet approach, both filming here, and, in a parallel mini Pantanal, in deepest, darkest Devon.
This is the unique world of specialist time lapse cameraman Tim Shepherd.
Tim has the reputation of being able to think like a plant.
It's absolutely crucial that you get the plant really happy.
And to make the giant lily feel totally at home, Tim must build a little piece of Brazilian wetland.
First, a 10,000 litre tank.
Hundreds of bricks, almost 1,000 kilos of soil and countless cups of tea later, the foundations are complete.
So far, so good.
Now time to prepare for the new green pellet camera system.
We're trying to assemble the main gantry framework so that we can mount the moving rig on top of it.
So it's a bit of a fiddle to get all the screws in all the right places, basically.
After a few weeks, the building works are complete.
The flood can now begin.
Tim needs to be sure everything in the room is heated to tropical temperatures before the star of the scene can move in.
Carefully grown at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, especially for us.
Everything depends on this one plant.
There will be no time for a second attempt.
And even more important for Tim to keep his guest happy and healthy.
This big monster need a lot of feeding.
We found we need about five sand bags full of compost every two or three weeks, so we just sort of lower them in and stick them down by the roots.
There you go.
Whilst the Devon giant settles in, the Pantanal crew are continuing to get their shots.
Time to see some giant water lilies underwater.
And I hope there's no anaconda.
Mission accomplished!
The pressure is now on Tim.
After months of pampering, the giant lily is ready for action.
First thing to film is a leaf spike rising up from the depths.
Luckily, there are no anacondas here.
The special camera weighs over 40 kilos.
It's suddenly become less heavy, which is good.
The new rig means Tim will be able to follow the emerging plant in any direction.
Wow, fancy!
The technology is working well, but nature is starting to derail Tim's plans.
We're tangled up in all these weeds.
What happens is we've got a bit of an ecosystem developing here and, before you know it, you get masses and masses of algae growing in amongst it all.
Think I've just released some anaerobic gases there.
No, not me, the algae!
State of the art tools help keep the algae at bay.
Just in time for Tim to film lift-off.
That's quite nice coming out of the water, look at that!
Tim's focus can now shift to the battle that's starting to take place on the surface.
I'm trying to film this new bud coming out on this lily leaf.
Give or take about three days to grow from where it is now.
Somewhere in this zone between these two other leaves.
I want that to last about ten seconds.
Ten seconds is about 250 frames.
That works out about one frame every 20 minutes.
But plants don't read scripts.
It's nature, it doesn't always do what you think it's going to do.
We've had a few false starts where the leaf has swung out of shot and gone somewhere else.
Or it just grows a lot quicker than you thought.
It's a challenge to get things right.
But with the combination of Tim's expertise and the new camera system, results are starting to look good.
I think the difference now with this series is we can bring the plants much more to life as characters and tell their story in a much more dynamic way.
It's great to be able to follow them around much more with the way you'd film an animal behaving.
These rigs have given us a whole new realm of possibilities.
After over a year of filming and recording 100,000 separate images, the secret life of the giant water lily and the battle of the Pantanal has been revealed.
Next time on The Green Planet, the ever changing seasonal world, full of hunters, tricksters and unlikely alliances.
Plants here are in a race against the clock.
Timing is everything.
The Open University has produced a poster that explores the vital role that plants have for our planet.
To order your free copy, call or go to and follow the links to the Open University.
This is the boreal forest the largest forest on Earth.
750 billion trees smothered by snow throughout the winter.
This is the northernmost boundary of an extraordinary world.
I'm standing at the edge of the Arctic Circle.
To the north of me lies a land dominated for most of the year by snow and ice. 3,000 miles to the south the tropics, bathed the year round in warm sunshine.
And in between, a very different world, dominated by relentless change.
An endless cycle of four distinct seasons, each with its own challenges.
The short, freezing days of winter give way to the urgent awakening of spring.
And the long, hot days of summer yield to the cooling of autumn.
Opportunities will be brief.
To survive these extremes, plants have not only got to be hardy and resilient, but many of them have developed special strategies in order to meet the demands of this seasonal world.
To succeed, they must get their timing just right.
For months now, this world has been asleep.
But change is coming.
Spring is on its way.
In Canada, the forests are starting to stir.
Throughout the winter, the sugar maples here have kept stores of nutrients ready for this moment.
Now, as temperatures start to rise, those nutrients must be brought up from the roots.
Sap is on the rise.
Fuel for new green growth.
But just as growth reaches full speed robbers arrive.
A sap sucker.
A thief in search of maple syrup.
The tree can tolerate hundreds of wounds.
But if they completely encircle the trunk, the tree will eventually die.
The sap sucker's break-in ﻿hasn't gone unnoticed.
Hummingbirds, squirrels and insects all invade the sap sucker's territory, trying to steal a meal.
But unwittingly, they help the tree.
Time spent chasing the competition means less time to drill new holes.
The tree gets a chance to repair its wounds.
And the sap can rise freely again.
So this year, at least, the tree will once more produce its leaves.
Hundreds of miniature solar panels that collect energy from the sunlight.
Each leaf is covered by millions of microscopic pores. Stomata.
They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen and water vapour in a process that produces high-energy fuel.
All the trees here can now use that fuel to grow over the coming months.
As spring proceeds, the power of the sun increases.
On river banks across Europe, many plants have been lying dormant underground, waiting for the earth to warm.
And now a race begins.
Among the first to start are nettles - the sprinters.
Then, only just behind, come the brambles.
They're much more aggressive and have backward-pointed hooks with which to scramble over their rivals.
Last to come - the climbers.
Hops and bryony.
They lasso their way towards the light.
Soon, every inch of space and every patch of light has been claimed.
But hidden in the shadows, another plant has been waiting to make its move.
This is dodder.
A hunter with an exceptional sense of smell.
Moving swiftly, it searches for its prey.
It detects the scent of a young nettle.
The dodder punctures the nettle's stem and sucks out the nutritious sap.
And it doesn't stop at just one victim.
With its energy supply assured, it multiplies.
It's a parasite with an insatiable appetite.
But remarkably, its victims can now exploit the dodder when other springtime enemies appear.
Caterpillars.
When under attack, a leaf sends out a signal telling the rest of the plant to start building defences foul-tasting toxins that deter the caterpillars.
In an extraordinary twist, the stems of the dodder interconnecting the plants are now being used as lines of communication to relay these warning signals from plant to plant.
They respond by producing their own protective chemicals.
Eventually, the whole river bank becomes one huge defensive network.
And the one-time rivals are now better off together.
The first warm days of spring encourage some plants to flower and get ahead of the competition creating beautiful displays throughout the seasonal world.
From the spectacular cherry blossoms of Japan to the goldfield flowers of California.
But spring flowering is risky.
If they flower too early, it may not be warm enough for pollinating insects to be active.
But the common daisy gives them every opportunity.
The warmer the flowers are, the more attractive they are and they have a remarkable strategy in order to maximise this.
They were closed up tightly throughout the night as a protection against the elements.
But once they feel the warmth and the light of the sun, they spring into action.
It's a behaviour called heliotropism.
They turn to keep facing the sun, absorbing as much heat as they can.
This is a thermal camera, and it will tell me the difference between the surrounding temperature and the temperature in the centre of a daisy flower.
The surroundings - 12 degrees.
In the centre of a flower
- 21 degrees.
Pollinators such as bees and wasps prefer the warmed-up flowers because they can get a share of the heat for themselves.
As a consequence,  they can collect more nectar from more flowers, pollinating as they go.
And the daisies, with the help of their pollinators, are able to have a particularly long flowering season.
But when the window of opportunity is brief, even more ingenious tactics are necessary.
Here in south-western Australia, summer temperatures can soar to up to 40 degrees Celsius.
Now, for a brief moment in the cooler spring, flowering plants must get busy.
And this hammer orchid, with its strange flower, ﻿ is doing exactly that.
It needs to attract a pollinator, but has no nectar and doesn't even look like a flower.
Unlike these neighbouring huge grass trees.
These produce thousands of tiny white flowers, all dripping with nectar.
But the orchid has a different strategy.
It synchronises its emergence with the brief mating season of the thynnid wasp.
The flightless female wasp produces pheromones to attract males.
This male detects a scent that seems to be hers yet flies right on by.
The orchid not only has the same shape and colour as a female wasp, but it sits at the same height as she does.
It even mimics her smell.
And the beguiled male attempts to mate with it.
He hammers against the orchid's pollen sacks.
And the wasp leaves, doubtless a little shaken only to be duped once again.
The pollen on his back now sticks to this different orchid.
And the deception has worked.
The orchid's imitation is even more intoxicating, it seems, than the real thing.
Eventually, the male wasps tire of the orchid's enticements.
And now, the wasps, both male and female, find the flowers of the grass trees to feed.
And there, at long last they mate.
And as for the hammer orchid?
Pollination is complete.
As summer approaches, the need to flower becomes more urgent.
And nowhere more so than here in South Africa.
This is the fynbos, part of the Cape floral kingdom, a great expanse of open heathlands just north of the cape.
Here there are more different species of plant than anywhere else in the world.
Nearly 9,000, many needing pollinators.
They compete with one another for such help by flaunting extravagant shapes and vivid colours.
All promising nectar as a sugary reward.
But there is a plant here that avoids this crowded competition.
And the rising temperatures of summer bring just what it needs.
This is the first fire here for 15 years.
Nearly all the plants are destroyed.
Incinerated.
It might seem from the smoke and the still-smouldering embers that no plant could survive such an inferno.
But just four days after the flames rising from the ashes a fire lily.
It has been lying dormant underground for 15 years, but now, awakened by the smoke, it flowers.
The blooms may be small and unshowy, but that's all they need to be.
In this charred landscape, pollinators, such as these sunbirds, can spot these little red beacons from great distances.
They're the only source of nectar around.
And the more visitors the flowers attract, the more likely they are to be pollinated.
It's just in time.
Within a few months, ﻿the whole landscape is alive once more.
In fact, all these plants need fire to survive.
And as competitors return, the fire lily fades.
It now returns underground and will rest there as a bulb until another fire awakens it.
By the time the long, hot days of summer arrive, wild flower meadows are bursting with life.
But autumn is not far away.
So now pollinated plants must use their remaining energy to produce the next generation.
Seeds.
A dandelion clock contains around 200 seeds each with its own tiny parachute.
Few seeds can fly as far as these.
Some are known to have travelled over 60 miles.
But to travel any distance at all, they need the wind to be just right.
However, before they can get away, there is a risk.
Voracious hunters live in this meadow.
Tiny harvest mice.
They love dandelion seeds.
But they don't like to share.
Finally, the sun warms the ground and a gentle breeze blows in, creating an ideal updraught.
Air flowing between the bristles creates a vortex that lifts the seeds up.
Heading off on a gentle breeze, this seed now starts its travels.
Plants use a variety of different techniques to spread their seeds as far as possible from themselves.
And one of the most remarkable is this one.
It's called ecballium, and it's a relative of the cucumber.
For several weeks now, pressure has been building up inside the pods.
Until now, they're as taut as a well-pumped-up bicycle tyre.
All they need is just a slight nudge.
The further the plant can fire its seeds, the better.
If a seedling germinates close to its parent, the two will have to compete for nutrients and light.
This Himalayan balsam has seed pods that react rather differently, like catapults.
As they dry out, they begin to strain along precisely positioned lines of weakness.
And then, just the slightest disturbance, even a single raindrop, is enough to trigger the mechanism.
The east coast of South Africa.
Summer here brings scorching temperatures.
This Ceratocaryum has to get its seeds underground before it gets too hot.
And it has acquired somewhat unlikely allies.
Dung beetles.
They have a particular fondness for antelope droppings.
At this time of the year, these beetles bury the dung and lay their eggs on it.
And the fresher the better.
﻿Ceratocaryum's spindly stems send their seeds flying.
They're the same size, shape and even smell remarkably like antelope dung.
The beetles simply can't resist them.
Dung beetles always bury dung balls at the same depth.
And it's one which suits the seeds very well.
So effective is the seed's deception that the beetles come back for more time and time again.
Most of the Ceratocaryum seeds get safely buried exactly where they need to be.
As the sun begins to retreat, so autumn arrives.
The cooler, shorter days are the cue for many seasonal forests to prepare for the winter shutdown.
The trees start to divert their nutrients back into their roots.
And there, other organisms await them.
Fungi.
Mushrooms are the familiar face of fungi, but they are merely the fruiting bodies.
Some of them only last for a few days.
They are, however, evidence of the giant organism that lies in the soil beneath.
Just a single handful of soil may contain several thousand metres of their microscopic filaments.
It's only recently that we have discovered the extraordinary role that these fungi play in a forest like this.
Their filaments plug into the tips of the tree's roots and nutrients pass between tree and fungus throughout the year.
Some fungi have the ability to link with not just a single tree, but with a whole group of trees, so that the entire forest may be linked together by these microscopic threads, to form what you might call a wood-wide web.
Hundreds of trees can be interconnected by these webs.
Scientists call it the mycorrhizal network.
And it might look something like this.
They've discovered that trees not only send nutrients along it but chemical and electrical signals, allowing them to communicate with one another.
But some trees can also be selfish and steal from their rivals.
Or even wage war by sending out toxins that will harm competitors.
It seems, however, that most trees do try to help each other.
They raise the alarm when attacked by leaf-eaters, leaving other trees time to produce defensive chemicals.
Those that are dying may send their food reserves to their neighbours.
And some individuals known as mother trees recognise their own offspring, and will channel resources to them so giving their young the best possible start in life.
As the harshness of winter approaches temperate woodlands from Russia to Canada are now in a race to shut down.
The green pigment in the leaves starts to break down and nutrients are withdrawn into the branches.
The chemical substances that are left behind then create one of the most spectacular displays of colour in the whole of nature.
The first freezing nights of winter bring with them a killer.
Frost.
Stems, when frozen, rupture.
And flowers of ice form in the chilly air.
For some, winter brings dormancy.
For others, it brings death.
Another cycle of the seasons comes to an end.
Plants all across the seasonal world have developed many different strategies for success.
But they all depend on the seasons changing reliably year after year.
It doesn't matter whether you live for 3,000 years or just a few months, everything depends on you getting the timing just right.
But in our changing world, this is becoming a greater challenge every year.
And even the most hardy and resilient of plants are starting to struggle.
These sequoia trees are the giants of the natural world, the largest living thing on the planet.
They can grow to almost 100 metres tall and 11 metres across.
Their bark alone can be over a half-a-metre thick.
They're also among the oldest, some living to over 3,000 years.
And to achieve such age and size, they need very particular living conditions, such as are found here in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California.
Not only do they need energy from the sun but, critically, they also require up to 4,000 litres of water a day.
So they are almost entirely reliant on the seasonal snowmelt.
But recent years have brought longer, hotter summers and their source of water is becoming increasingly unreliable.
Scientists are discovering that even these seemingly indestructible giants are now starting to show signs of vulnerability.
Some are shedding their needles and branches as a way of conserving precious water.
But for others, climate change has already been fatal.
10% of them have been lost in just the last few years.
A single giant sequoia in its lifetime can produce 100 million seeds.
These, in my hand, from one cone, are more than enough to start a completely new forest.
But they can only do such a thing in a world where the seasons change with some reliability.
Today, our climate is changing, bringing an unprecedented level of unpredictability all across the seasonal world.
The question is, can we curb climate change sufficiently to ensure that the seasons will continue?
Only if we can do that will the future of seasonal plants, including these magnificent trees, be assured.
During filming The Green Planet, it wasn't only the plants that struggled to get their timing right.
The increasing unpredictability of the seasons made it frustratingly difficult for the crew to be in the right place at the right time.
Whether the height of summer we are in the middle of a biblical rainstorm or a quiet autumnal afternoon.
This is crazy.
Hurricanes are no joke.
They were always kept on their toes.
That's really scary.
Sometimes very numb ones.
It's been the most snow they've had for 38 years, and I think this is now our fifth filming trip in a row where the seasons haven't done what they're predictably meant to do every year.
And these challenges continue in attempting to find and film an elusive plant with a remarkable survival strategy.
The fire lily.
Somewhere out there is a tiny, tiny red plant in all of that.
Travelling to South Africa at the height of summer the crew witnessed many extraordinary flowers bursting into bloom.
But if they are to see a fire lily, ﻿they need a fire.
None of the team have filmed wildfire before not something to be underestimated.
In most cases, with wildfires, is that, when they go wrong, they go wrong radically,and it's very unforgiving.
If you get caught on the wrong side of a fire ﻿because you want to get that special shot, there's a possibility you can get killed.
That's really what it comes down to.
And after some understandably studious note-taking it's time to put their training to the test.
The fire's just racing up a gully behind me.
The heat is intense.
It's insane.
This is what any fire lilies here should be waiting for.
But fynbos wildfires are starting to become fiercer than in the past.
Something fire chief Reinard Geldenhuys knows first-hand.
Nowadays, we're experiencing more extreme temperature conditions and more extreme wind conditions, which exacerbates a fynbos fire.
Fynbos fire in full tilt, with a strong wind behind it, is an animal that's just running wild.
It's a very frightening sight if you're standing in front of it.
Guided by the experience of the fire crew, the team are able to safely capture the full fury of the blaze.
It's given me a complete new appreciation for fire.
How intensely it burns and how quickly it roars through this environment.
And the fact that any plants can survive afterwards it's crazy.
As destructive as it seems, the fire has been part of this ecosystem for millennia.
Fires should refresh and regenerate the landscape.
Worryingly, however, this fine balance between plant and fire is beginning to shift.
More extreme wildfires may spell disaster.
If you disturb the soil in a fynbos system, you're going to lose a lot of species.
Bigger, hotter fires can burn the soil there and burn out all the seeds.
And for the species that have these really intricate strategies,like the fire lily, it really is a difficult game.
Every year is getting hotter and potentially drier.
So it's kind of becoming Russian roulette for a lot of the species here.
In the fire's aftermath, the crew must now try to find a tiny flower but have any survived the blaze?
It just looks completely dead, the whole valley.
There's nothing for it but to get their hands dirty.
Searching in the ash is a grubby business.
I feel disgusting.
After scouring this mountainside just days after it burned they finally find the first signs of regeneration.
Wow. That's what it's all about. That's the fire lily.
It's like a pop of bright red against all the black.
That's amazing. There's another one over there, and there's another one behind us.
This place hasn't burned for 15 years, so they've been sat underground waiting for this precise moment for that entire time. And then, within two weeks, they're up and they're flowering. It's incredible.
This time, the fire lilies here succeeded in flowering.
But in the 15 years since they last bloomed, ﻿the Earth has experienced ten of the warmest years on record.
There's huge debates about climate change how real is it, really, and so on.
We experience it in the fire.
It's more intense, burns easier, burns longer.
In the past, we used to have one big fire per season, and we said, "Ja, that was a big one."
Now we have five to six big ones per season.
If we don't change our ways, we are going to reach a point where fires are burning with such ferocity that it will destroy the landscape.
And in recent times, a rapidly changing climate has led to some of the biggest fires in living memory - not just in South Africa, but around the world.
The next five to ten years are going to be pretty scary to actually see what this has done to the ecosystem.
Let's hope that the next time this fire lily blooms, it will find a world in which it can still survive.
The Taklamakan Desert in northern China, a constantly shifting landscape of sand.
Temperatures that swing from -20 to more than 40 degrees centigrade and, most critically, almost entirely without rain.
Yet, here on the dunes a Euphrates poplar tree.
And it's not alone.
Some of these trees have lived here for 1,000 years.
They have exceptionally long roots with which to collect water, and what is more, those roots are connected to neighbouring trees, so that if one strikes water, others can share it.
In every desert across the planet, plants have found ways to not only survive, but flourish.
This is the Gran Desierto of Mexico and the United States.
These dunes may appear to be totally barren.
In fact, they are full of life.
In the sand beneath my feet there are seeds of many different kinds.
In fact, you could say that the dune itself is one great seed bank, and when it rains, it bursts into life.
But rain may come only once a decade, tand even then,he long-awaited storm may be very brief.
So seeds must respond immediately.
This is sand verbena.
It can grow from a seed to a sweetly-scented flowering plant in just a few weeks.
Primroses and many other plants soon join the race to flower before the sand dries.
Desert blooms like this, however, are rare.
This is the first year for 20 years.
The combination of vibrant colour and powerful scent attracts migrating pollinators, such as these Painted Lady butterflies, which fly into the middle of what were, only recently, barren dunes.
Everything is rushing to complete their lives before the moisture has gone.
Such spectacular blooms transform deserts all around the world.
From the Atacama in South America to the dusty plains of southern Africa.
Rain in deserts, however, never lasts long, and all too soon, the flowers wither and die.
But not before they've produced the next generation the seeds that will now wait in the sand for the next rains.
In the Sonoran Desert of North America, the huge saguaro cacti have a different strategy.
They store water in quantity and can live to a great age.
But in their early years, they are extremely vulnerable.
This little saguaro cactus is about ten-years-old.
When they're really small and growing out in the open, there's a real chance that they may shrivel up and die.
But this one has been lucky.
It's been growing in the shade of this mesquite tree, and it's got a very good chance of surviving to maturity.
The young saguaro is protected by the mesquite's branches.
They halve the amount of scorching sunlight reaching the cactus and so, keep it cool.
And the mesquite's extremely long roots draw up water, bringing it within reach of the young saguaro.
So the mesquite is known as a 'nurse plant', and a very effective one it is, too.
In fact, this particular mesquite has already nurtured seven young saguaros over the past 30 years.
As a young cactus grows, it needs the protection of its nurse plant, not only from the heat, but from the other hazards of desert life.
Temperatures can drop to -10 degrees overnight and very occasionally it even snows.
If the water stored inside a young cactus should freeze, the cactus will die.
But the nurse plant traps a blanket of slightly warmer air around it, just enough to keep it alive.
Eventually, saguaros outgrow their nurses, but by that time,they are robust enough to face the elements by themselves.
No matter how old a desert plant is, water is always precious, whether gathered from melting snow or a shower of rain.
So, cacti have developed extraordinary adaptations that enable them to not only collect water but to retain it.
Instead of leaves, which would lose precious moisture through evaporation, they have spines.
Each spine has a tiny pad at its base where the water is absorbed and then stored in the great swollen trunk.
A large saguaro can hold 5,000 litres of water and is able to do so because it has another special adaptation.
The ridges on its surface are like the pleats on an accordion.
They allow the saguaro to change its shape.
After rain has fallen, the pleats expand and the saguaro fills up its water tank.
In the dry times, it uses its water to grow, produce flowers and, eventually, seeds.
Fully-loaded with thousands of litres of water, this saguaro won't need to drink a single drop for another year.
But such valuable stores of water attract thieves.
Now the spine's function changes from collecting to guarding.
The spines of some species are a quarter of a metre long.
Others are needle-like barbs that grow in clusters and easily break off in the skin of any animal that touches them.
But perhaps the most vicious cacti belong to a group called the chollas.
This is called a teddy-bear cholla because of the thick coating of spines on it.
But don't be deceived by the name, there is nothing cuddly about THIS particular teddy bear.
In fact, it's the most dangerous plant in the desert, and I wouldn't dream of putting my hand anywhere near it without proper protection.
Brush against it this can happen.
This can happen, even with this glove on.
One of them has just gone through, I can feel it.
It's quite painful!
Look closely at the spine and you can see very clearly Each is like a splinter of glass, sharp enough to pierce flesh and they're covered with backward-pointing barbs.
So getting them out, even with a pair of pliers, is quite hard.
This is not pleasant at all.
It won't come off, or without.
Oh, look at that!
It's hard to imagine a more aggressive defence than this, and it makes both the plant and its buds virtually invulnerable.
Most animals know to keep clear.
Cholla buds grow like tiny barrels from the top of the adult plant and then drop off.
If the young cholla put down roots here, it would compete with its parent for water.
Night falls and this one is on the move.
A pack rat. She knows how to deal with a cholla.
She avoids the spines by gripping it at the place where it broke off from its parent.
And she works fast.
There are pack rat hunters here.
She uses the cholla to build a spiny wall around her nest.
The flesh of the cholla supplies her with water and the severed spines further reinforce the defences.
This cholla bud might be next.
But one accidental nudge and it escapes.
The bud starts to put down roots.
So, the cholla, thanks to the pack rats, finds new territory and sets about claiming it.
Few plants deal with the problems of desert living better than cacti. ﻿ There are almost 2,000 different species of them.
They're spread across the deserts of the American West, from Arizona, all the way to Mexico and beyond.
In South America, the ice-covered peaks of the Andes act as a rain barrier beyond which lies the world's driest desert the Atacama.
In the desert world, water thieves can come in many forms to exploit even the smallest chink in a plant's defence.
One of the strangest travels within the gut of a fruit-eating mockingbird.
These are the seeds of Tristerix, a kind of mistletoe.
Their goal is the water inside this hedgehog cactus.
Using the spines as anchors, the seeds start to germinate.
Each produces a long probe with which to try and locate the cactus' skin.
For most, that's a stretch too far, and they perish.
But for this one, the cactus' surface is within reach.
It clamps onto it with a special sucker and then waits for darkness.
At night, the cactus opens its pores in order to respire.
Oxygen goes out, carbon dioxide goes in, and so does Tristerix.
Once within, its tissues spread throughout the body of the cactus, sustained by the precious store of water that they find there.
Then, a year later, it breaks through the cactus' skin and bursts into flower.
Hummingbirds come to drink their nectar and pollinate them as they do so.
And, then, to complete the cycle, Tristerix produces hundreds of white, eye-catching seeds, ready to be carried away by a bird to invade another cactus.
The Karoo Desert in southern Africa.
And although it may look bare, its rocky ground contains an unrivalled variety of plants that, one way or another, store water in their tissues.
They belong to many different families, but as a group, they're known as succulents.
Some are small and low and barely distinguishable from their surroundings.
These look like little pebbles.
They resemble them so closely that animals which might be only too glad to steal their water just pass them by.
When rain does fall, they absorb it and quickly expand.
But even this doesn't spoil their disguise.
They just look like larger pebbles.
Nor are they green.
The cells on their top surface are transparent and allow sunlight to pass through.
Deep within and out of sight are the green cells where photosynthesis occurs the process which uses this light to make food for the plant.
When the time comes to reproduce, however, the stone plant abandons its disguise.
The flowers open and close every 24 hours.
So for a few dangerous days, the plant advertises for pollinators before returning to life as a pebble.
Some desert plants have developed a very different way of attracting pollinators.
This is a Stapelia.
It produces what is perhaps the desert's strangest disguise.
It uses water stored in its stems to grow buds the size of tennis balls.
The flower, once opened, is called a desert starfish.
Instead of releasing millions of loose pollen grains as most flowers do, the desert starfish produces them packed in five tiny sacks.
But if its strategy is successful, just one of them will produce hundreds of seeds and this depends on deception.
The flower appears to have hair wrinkly skin and it produces a stench like the carcass of a dead animal.
And when a carrion fly investigates the flower tempts a tiny sack of pollen to its proboscis.
It isn't easy to feed with such encumbered mouthparts.
But try as it might, the fly can't get rid of it.
And it's still there when the fly leaves to try and feed from another bogus carcass.
This time, however, when its clamped-up proboscis,slots into the flower,  the pollen sack is released.
With pollination complete, the fly is no longer needed and just as well.
Some deserts can be so dry that plants must find techniques of surviving for long periods without any water whatsoever.
One of them is to grow extremely slowly, and few plants grow more slowly than this one the creosote bush.
It is inactive for most of its life and only wakes up and grows for a brief period, if and when there is a fall of rain.
I've seen evidence of this "grow slow" strategy for myself.
40 years ago, I came here to California's Mojave Desert to visit one particular plant.
An individual creosote bush tends to spread not by setting seeds and producing a new generation, but by sending out new stems around its base.
This plant started growing between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago.
That was in 1982.
Since then, careful measurement has shown that it has increased its size by less than one inch.
Its ability to endure is truly extraordinary.
So efficient is creosote at collecting what little rain falls here, that few other plants can compete with it.
As a result, over the last 12,000 years, it's come to completely dominate this landscape.
The Chihuahuan Desert in north Mexico.
Here, one particular plant plays the waiting game so well that it spends much of its life looking dead and certainly not worth eating.
And it can survive like this for a decade.
This is the resurrection plant.
It's a kind of moss.
It barely has roots, and it certainly can't store much water, but it can travel.
After a particularly long drought it breaks away from its roots and becomes a tumbleweed.
Blowing across the desert, it can travel a mile in a week.
With luck, it may find water.
Just a shower of rain can bring it back to life.
As its fronds soak up the water, they unfurl.
In its protected centre, it still has green cells which absorb both the water and sunlight and rapidly produce the food it needs to resume its growth.
It will grow for just as long as there is moisture but when that disappears it closes up once more and resumes its travels.
Here in the Canyonlands of Utah lives a plant that has developed a finely-balanced relationship with the animals with which it shares this dramatic desert.
Rain does occasionally fall here and turns dust into mud.
But that doesn't last long.
A brief window of opportunity opens.
Seeds that have been buried for years may now be exposed to light and come to life.
This is coyote tobacco.
In just a few weeks, it grows a metre tall and produces dozens of flowers.
The night air becomes heavy with their fragrance.
Soon, they attract hawk moths which sip their nectar, and in doing so, pollinate them.
But the moths also lay their eggs on them.
Soon, the caterpillars have hatched and are munching the leaves.
Their nibbles expose the plant's sap to the drying air.
But the tobacco plant has a defence.
The leaves under attack produce nicotine.
This chemical sedates the caterpillars and slows them down.
And what is more, it makes them give off a particular scent one that summons others to come to the plant's aid.
Big-eyed bugs, miniature assassins, only two millimetres long and whiptail lizards.
Big or small, they make a meal of the caterpillars.
It's certainly effective but there's more to this strategy than meets the eye.
When the leaf of a tobacco plant is attacked by a caterpillar, all the rest of the leaves prepare to defend themselves.
But how does this leaf know that that leaf there is under attack?
Scientists here in the United States have specially genetically modified these tobacco plants so that under special lighting conditions, this microscope can show us exactly what is going on.
I'm going to attack one of the leaves of this plant with these tweezers which, to the plant, will seem as if it's being nibbled by a caterpillar.
Signals are being transmitted along the veins that link the leaf to the rest of the plant.
It's rather like a very simple nervous system.
From that initial injury, the whole of this little plant is aware that something has happened.
This signal warns each leaf of the danger, so that it is ready to produce nicotine the moment it's attacked.
With this defence at the ready, the tobacco plant can continue to grow until eventually, it produces seeds.
It's particularly important in deserts for seeds to be distributed as widely as possible so that some will have a chance of reaching moisture.
And deserts have an excellent agent to help them do that the wind.
Many seeds have adaptations to help them exploit it.
They have shell to protect the seeds within from abrasion or wings to help them catch the air.
As the temperature rises throughout the day, desert winds increase in strength.
Here in Arizona, the land is regularly swept by what is known as a haboob.
It's a giant sandstorm, but also, in effect, a seed storm.
Countless millions of them are swept up into the air.
Some seeds can travel thousands of miles on the wind so that plants may eventually reach even the most isolated desert.
Some have landed on an island in the middle of the world's largest salt flat in Bolivia.
In the Galapagos, they sprout on fields of recently-erupted lava.
They've even reached one of the most inhospitable of all sites the tiny island of San Pedro Martir, a scorched, lonely rock off the coast of Mexico.
This is the home of the giant cardon, a species of huge cactus that can weigh up to 12 tonnes.
They're able to thrive here because of an extraordinary partnership with brown and blue-footed boobies.
The cardones here can become so broad that they provide cooling shade for nesting birds.
As the booby chicks get older, they repay the cardones with their droppings guano the digestive remains of vast shoals of fish.
This guano is of such strength and quantity that most plants would be poisoned by it.
These cardones, however, have evolved the ability to tolerate the toxins in the guano and digest the nutrients.
As a result, the cacti now grow in a dense forest over a million strong.
But such relationships are very finely balanced and can only too easily tip into catastrophe as is now happening in northern Zimbabwe.
For six months of the year, the savannah here is kept lush and green by daily rains.
But when the rainy season is over, it becomes as dry as any desert.
So to survive here, trees must be able to tolerate both conditions.
And these giants are adapted to do just that.
They are baobabs.
This one might be over 1,000 years old.
It survives here in part thanks to its ability to store thousands of litres of water within the spongy wood of its trunk.
But its battered surface is evidence of a very finely-balanced relationship.
These huge trees are a focus for animals of all kinds.
And they're particularly important for elephants.
In the wet season, they eat the baobab's fruit and disperse the seeds in their dung.
Now as the dry season begins they migrate to distant watering holes.
The baobabs have damp inner wood and the elephants use it to quench their thirst on the journey.
This relationship can only work because baobabs have a remarkable ability to heal themselves.
Between each damaging attack, they expand their spongy wood and grow new skin.
And they've done this time and time again over centuries.
Today, however, it's harder for the baobabs to recover as dry seasons become longer and drier due to climate change.
Not only that, but the elephants are forced to take ever more wood from the trees in order to survive.
In some parts of Africa, many of the largest and oldest baobabs have fallen in the last decade.
The loss of a vital species like the baobab strikes a blow at all life in the desert.
In these hostile lands, few living organisms can survive without help from others.
You can find an extraordinary illustration of this in Arizona's saguaro country.
If you wander off the beaten track here, you may be lucky enough to find one of these.
It might look like an old boot, but in fact, it's part of a saguaro cactus.
Almost every saguaro has one.
There's one up there.
It has been produced indirectly by woodpeckers, which regularly dig homes for themselves in the bloated trunks of the saguaros.
In the next six months, the cactus heals the wound and so creates a safe, cool, and watertight nest hole.
Its tough lining will persist for years, even after the cactus itself has died and rotted away.
A single saguaro may hold several of these extraordinary homes.
So over its lifetime, it may provide accommodation for some 3,000 chicks of several different species.
But in the long term, the saguaro benefits, as their lodgers repay the cactus by pollinating its flowers and dispersing its seeds.
It's relationships like these that enable life to flourish in some of the world's harshest landscapes.
Over millions of years, plants have become superbly adapted to hostile desert conditions.
But it's a very finely-balanced existence and one that makes them uniquely vulnerable.
However, our growing understanding of the complex ways by which desert animals and plants rely on one another is now helping us to understand how best we can protect them.
90 years ago, a photograph was taken from this very spot that shows a population of saguaro cactus that was very different from what it is today.
In the last 50 years, the population of saguaros here has greatly diminished, not because of a direct assault on the cactus, but because many of the shade-giving nurse trees were harvested for firewood, leaving young saguaro to die in the sun.
Now that this relationship is understood and the nurse trees are protected, there are already signs that the saguaro are recovering.
Wherever there's a desert, plants have evolved to meet its challenge.
But everywhere, they need our help.
As we understand more about them and their intimate and complex relationships we will be better able to protect them and all life in these beautiful but increasingly fragile worlds.
The most remote shoot for the deserts team is to the island of San Pedro Martir in the Sea of Cortez, Mexico.
They are to film the giant cacti that have found a unique way to thrive here.
It takes 48 hours to travel the 260 miles over unpleasantly choppy seas.
It's not made some of us feel very well.
I think one of us is quite seasick.
It's nothing but big blue out there, and the island is somewhere in that direction.
Can't see it yet.
As they draw close to the island, there's a spectacular reminder of how rich life in the sea is here.
Oh, look in front of us! Look at that for a pod!
Oh! They're everywhere!
Show us the way.
Meeting them here is desert scientist Ben Wilder.
It's through his research that the team first heard about the island's peculiar residents.
I'll never forget the first time I came to, actually, exactly where we're standing right now.
It was April of 2006, and saw this view.
And it both settled in my heart and captivated my mind.
And so that started a process of trying to understand, what can produce this marine waters in the world.
The secret is in the relationship between the cactus and a type of sea bird called a booby.
All the boobies that we need to film are right up there at the top of the island.
So, it's going to be a bit of a scramble.
The crew soon discover how harsh the conditions are here.
I'm pretty tired. It's pretty hot.
It's a great view.
There's very few places on Earth where you're going to see this many cactus.
I mean, it's absolutely amazing.
I would say this is the only place you're going to see this.
There you go, then.
Ben's research is uncovering the ingenious ways the cacti have adapted to the conditions here.
The waters just offshore here are some of the most productive so it's kind of an ideal habitat for sea birds to roost.
But when they do so, they deposit tonnes of guano.
And so those nutrients, really high in nitrogen and phosphorus, actually are toxic to most plant species.
The cardones thrive because they're uniquely able to process the guano and extract what they need to fuel their growth.
One of the first shots the crew need to get is of the boobies nesting under the cacti.
The lack of predators means the birds aren't afraid of people.
It should make filming them up close a bit easier.
That's the theory.
So we've positioned this camera here to try and get a good perspective on the chick on the nest.
It's taken quite a liking to our camera.
Let's hope he doesn't break it.
Bull's-eye.
It's pooed right on the front of the lens!
It's kind of a shot we need, but unfortunately, my camera wasn't rolling at the time it did it.
So now, I've just got a dirty lens.
After a thorough lens clean, Ollie eventually gets the shot to reveal the extraordinary relationship between bird and plant.
But it's not just the bird guano that influence how the cardones grow.
They're way shorter, they're dwarfed here, throughout the rest of their range, they usually get in upwards of 50-60 feet.
But here, on average, they're 20-24 feet in height.
They stop growing up, and they grow out.
Ben's research suggests that they go wide here as an adaptation to the violent winds.
Too tall, and they'd blow over.
A gusting wind isn't helping the drone crew, either.
We really need it to calm down a bit, otherwise it's going to be impossible.
On the Sonoran mainland, where the cardon is also found, you have on average between 50 to 150 plants per hectare.
Here on this island, you have over 2,500 plants per hectare.
A lull in the wind, and the team get the chance to reveal the remarkable density of the cacti, almost 20 times greater than anywhere else.
It appears that here they're doing very well.
But even this island isn't isolated from the effects of a changing planet.
Every cactus you see there, its body is filled with nutrients from the sea.
Given that we know that the cardones are linked to the ocean, what happens in the oceans affects what happens to the cardon.
So a concern we have right now is that there's a lot of overfishing, and we know there are less sea birds here than there were 20 years ago.
And we have reason to believe then that will ripple and affect the nutrients that fuel the cardones as well.
This finely-balanced relationship is at risk, and knowing that makes leaving the island particularly thought provoking for the crew.
The cardones look beautiful.
I've never seen so many cactus in my life.
It's absolutely amazing.
I'm just hoping that when we leave this place, it stays as it is, and things don't affect it that are negative.
It's an absolutely wonderful thing, I don't want to go. I want to stay.
This remote cactus forest is a reminder of the adaptability of plants that enables them to establish green worlds almost anywhere on Earth.
The relationship between plants and humans is extraordinary.
We've been adapting to each other for as long as we've been on the planet.
We rely upon plants for almost everything.
The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, much of the clothes we wear, in some parts of the world, the very buildings in which we live.
But that relationship is now changing.
How it changes next will shape the future of our green planet.
Some plants have the ability to live alongside us even when we make it extremely difficult for them to do so.
This is Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London.
It would be difficult to imagine a more hostile place for a plant.
And yet, even here, plants will find a way.
Plants like this may seem to follow us wherever we go.
We call them, perhaps a little unkindly, weeds.
In fact, these plants are pioneers, the ones that are most able to take advantage of new habitats, even very harsh ones.
This wall is at least 100 years old.
It's like a sheer cliff face with no sign of soil, and yet this ivy-leaved toadflax thrives here.
The plant grows towards the light with its flowers facing outwards to attract pollinators.
But once they've succeeded in doing that and the seed pods start to develop, its behaviour changes.
For now, the pods turn and grow away from the light, seeking the darkest place they can find.
A crevice, perhaps, like this one.
It's all the toadflax needs.
It can now germinate and start to produce a new plant.
Other pioneers have a different strategy.
They instead distribute their seeds far and wide in great numbers.
Sow thistles are masters of this trick.
Each of its seeds is equipped with a tiny downy parachute, which will catch the slightest breeze.
And they can travel extraordinary distances.
They can rise a mile high in the sky and reach places hundreds of miles away from the parent plant.
The seeds only need to find the tiniest chink and they can take hold.
We barely notice many of these plant invaders.
But here in the heart of Hong Kong, strangler fig seeds that landed on a stone wall generations ago, have spread their flexible branching roots far and wide.
They can be anchored so firmly that they become a part of the city's architecture.
This is perhaps the ultimate weed.
But there are places where the extraordinary abilities of fig trees have created a very different relationship with human beings.
Meghalaya in north-east India, a high altitude plateau riven by dizzyingly steep valleys.
It's home to the Khasi people who've learned how to use the remarkable properties of fig trees to help them live in such difficult country.
As in Hong Kong, the tree's numerous roots anchor it firmly, here to steep mountainsides.
These roots can grow up to 2.5cm a day.
They are unusually strong, flexible, and can develop into a multitude of shapes.
The Khasi persuade them to provide them with stairs.
The monsoon season brings a seemingly insurmountable challenge for Khasi communities.
This is the wettest place in the world.
Nearly 30cm of rain can fall in a day.
Rivers become lethal torrents, dividing communities from each other.
This is when the relationship between fig trees and the Khasi becomes most important.
They deliberately plant fig trees near the rivers.
When they're mature enough to have developed many hanging roots, Shining Star Kongthaw begins working with them.
He guides the roots through bamboo tubes that are pointed towards the opposite river bank.
These strands will combine as they grow, sharing nutrients and resources and becoming stronger than a lone strand could ever be.
As the years pass, the growing roots become a living bridge.
As they grow, they become ever stronger and more stable.
This unusual relationship has allowed the people here to thrive in an otherwise challenging landscape.
But there are plants that have found a deeper partnership with us, and in doing so, have changed landscapes across the globe.
It began over 10,000 years ago, with plants that we found especially good to eat.
At first, this relationship created challenges of its own.
Many of the ancestral grasses, like these wild oats from Israel, have a trick to ensure that their seeds are planted in the perfect place.
Each seed head, at the top, carries two long bristles called awns, and when a seed drops to the ground, these awns do something truly extraordinary they walk.
The awns twist as they dry out during the day, and then when they get wet they untwist.
Tiny hairs grip on to the ground, keeping the individual moving forward.
In this way, the seeds work their way along the ground until eventually they find a rock to hide under or a crack to drill in to.
This adaptation is useful for the plant, but not for us.
It's hard to collect seeds when they drop off and walk away.
So our ancestors selected plants whose seeds don't drop off, don't have legs and don't bury themselves out of reach.
They also selected those individuals which put their energy into developing much larger seeds.
Close relationships like this have developed all over the world, producing the plants that are now our crops.
This may seem a poor deal from the point of view of plants, but not so.
We eat their seeds, but in return, we cherish and cultivate them, and now they are widespread and far more abundant than their wild ancestors.
You might call this a bargain between ourselves and plants, and over the years, it's proved extraordinarily powerful.
In the beginning, the bargain operated on a small scale.
Plant, tend and harvest by hand in small patches.
Over time, these plants produced more food, increasingly efficiently and the partnerships became more exclusive.
We started doing more and more for a small number of chosen species.
These few persuaded us to eliminate their competitors, cure their diseases, poison their enemies, and keep them well-watered, even when other species faced drought.
Fewer and fewer plant species, like soy, wheat and rice, now occupy more and more land.
And so now whole landscapes are dominated by a single species of plant.
A monoculture.
This is the Central Valley of California, the biggest orchard in the world.
A million acres of just one type of tree, almonds.
Each flower, if it's fertilised by pollen from a different almond tree, will produce an almond nut.
The flowers, patterns and scent have evolved to attract insects and bribe them to do that job for them.
The pollen doesn't have to move far, it just needs to reach a neighbouring tree.
There are about 20,000 flowers on each tree and 140 million trees.
That is billions of flowers all calling out at once.
But here, the beauty of the blossom is wasted.
To make way for these almond trees, the land was, in effect, wiped clean.
Countless wild species of plants and animals were removed, including, critically, pollinators.
So now the flowers need help, and lots of it.
40 billion honeybees trucked in from all over the United States.
The orchard is only in bloom for a few weeks, so the almonds need the bees to get to work immediately.
Each bee can visit thousands of blossoms a day.
And while they take most of the pollen they collect back to the hive, they also drop some pollen at each stop.
And, so, with luck, the flowers are all eventually fertilised.
Day after day, the process is repeated.
Flower after flower.
Tree after tree.
By the time the petals fall, 2.5 trillion flowers have been successfully pollinated and will now grow in to 2.5 trillion almonds.
This type of intensive, streamlined agriculture produces amazingly high yields.
But monocultures are fragile.
While they can function effectively when conditions remain stable, it only takes a small change to create catastrophe.
Lodgepole pine, a very valuable timber tree grown extensively in western Canada.
Millions of acres of the same species, all the same age and the same size.
For centuries, lodgepole forests have lived in a natural balance with their enemies, including this one, the mountain pine beetle.
In summer, female beetles start hunting for a suitable nursery in which to lay their eggs.
The ideal site is a mature lodgepole pine with bark thick enough to feed a female's brood and, critically, to protect them from the bitter cold of the coming winter.
Once under the bark, she tunnels upwards laying her eggs as she goes.
A single female beetle can lay 100 eggs in a season.
When the larvae hatch, they grow by feeding on the inside of the bark.
As they do, they damage the channels that transport water and nutrients between the roots and needles.
For centuries, the freezing northern winters killed the majority of larvae, so tree and beetle remained in balance.
But now, with the climate changing, the winters aren't cold enough to control the beetle numbers.
Needles turning red are a sure sign that the trees are dying.
The beetle plague spreads like wildfire across a landscape covered by a monoculture of similarly vulnerable trees.
Since the first mass outbreak 40 years ago, trillions of trees in North America have been killed by the mountain pine beetle.
Loss of plant diversity makes any habitat more vulnerable to changing conditions.
Now, with climate changing so fast, we are losing plant diversity just when we need it the most.
Two out of five plants are now facing extinction.
Of course, the loss of any one species is in itself a tragedy, but such a loss erodes the stability of a whole ecosystem, and that should be of great concern for all of us.
We need an insurance policy, a hedge against extinction.
This is Kew's Millennium Seed Bank.
Packets of seeds arrive here from all over the world.
These are from a relative of the yucca plant, which grows in central Mexico on the slopes of volcanoes, and nowhere else.
Most of the seeds are from plants that are threatened.
Some indeed, have gone extinct since their seeds arrived here.
But here, at least, those seeds are safe.
When they arrive, they're processed and sealed in to airtight jars.
Seeds are then brought underground to be stored in a vault, like this one, at -20C.
Since the bank was founded, two billion seeds from 40,000 different species have been brought and stored here.
Because a seed contains everything it needs to start a new plant, each and every one of them represents a little grain of hope.
Hope that one day we will make it possible for the seeds of these rarities to grow in the wild once again.
The seed bank certainly gives us options when a species becomes rare or even extinct.
But around the world, people are trying ways to keep natural plant populations healthy where they should be, in the wild.
Hawaii.
90% of the plant species here are found nowhere else in the world.
Many are threatened by a plant invader called Miconia.
It was brought to the island of Maui in the '70s as an ornamental plant.
In its native Mexico, it grows in balance with a rich variety of predators, competitors and diseases.
It grows taller than most native Hawaiian vegetation, and little can grow beneath it.
On the island of Maui, with nothing to keep it in check, it creates a stifling monoculture.
Miconia, it would appear, is doing very well for itself.
But today it's under attack.
On level ground, a single dedicated team can keep Miconia in check.
But unfortunately, this plant can spread to places impossible for people to reach on foot.
Just one plant can produce around ten million seeds a year, enough to cover this entire landscape.
With so much at stake, the team have come up with an extraordinary plan.
It's too dangerous to land here, but they don't need to.
A marksman with great skill can shoot the Miconia with paint balls full of herbicide.
A perfect shot is one that hits the stem, so ensuring that the herbicide spreads throughout the plant.
The method is so precise that with careful flying and accurate aim, they can kill the intruders without damaging any wild plants.
Destroying alien invaders is not the only way to help the native plants here.
This is Waikamoi Preserve, the last surviving fragment of a high-altitude Hawaiian rainforest, and home to one of the world's rarest plants.
Holokea.
There are only 57 fully-grown individuals left in the wild.
Their peculiar flowers evolved to suit the beak of a bird found only in Hawaii, the 'i'iwi.
The bird is now so rare itself that, today, these partners seldom, if ever, meet.
So the chances of holokea getting pollinated are very slim.
But a strange new partnership might just save it.
I look at losing a plant as flying in a plane and taking a screw out and, yeah, the plane will fly and you might be able to take a couple of screws out and keep flying, but eventually you're going to crash.
Hank knows where to find every one of the last 57 plants, and he returns every year to act as their pollinator.
We have to step in and play that role as pollinator or matchmaker.
Hank collects the pollen from the male flower and dusts it onto a female flower of a different plant.
He's currently their life support, but his goal is for holokea to thrive without him.
So, before he leaves, he plays the call of the 'i'iwi bird.
Hank hopes the sound will attract the living birds, and if they come, that they will reconnect with the last holokea and rekindle their vital relationship.
I believe all species are important and I believe we have a duty to act.
We need to act, not only in the wild places, but even in those where we live and where we farm.
Like much of the world, Kenya is losing thousands of native trees annually.
Ones that local people rely on for so much, especially fuel.
But here, people have come up with an ingenious way to reverse some of that loss around them.
At a factory in the outskirts of Nairobi, workers collect and sort waste charcoal dust.
Seeds of carefully selected native trees are mixed with the dust.
This carbon coat will protect the seeds from hungry animals until the rains arrive.
These are seed balls.
In the village of Kibwezi, acacia trees are becoming scarce, cut down by previous generations to make charcoal.
But the students at this school make forest restoration child's play.
The nutrients in the dissolving char dust will give each little seed a good start.
If only a handful of these seeds grow into a tree, the effort has been well worth it.
Every mature acacia tree can itself produce thousands of seeds a year.
13 million seed balls have been distributed in Kenya alone and the methods by which they're dispersed are ever more inventive, to say the least.
This technique is being repeated around the globe.
Seed-ball-making workshop.
People are choosing seeds of local native plants, giving them a little initial help and bringing some wild plants back into the world around them.
But is it possible, even in our most extreme monocultures, to invite a bit of wildness in and, with it, a bit of resilience?
I have two different kinds of forage growing in my orchard.
The yellow that you see behind me is a variety of different mustards.
And then after the bloom, we're going to see some clover blossom.
This mix of plants means the bees can feed before and after the brief almond bloom.
And they also get a more balanced, healthier diet.
In the meantime, it's going to provide habitat for all sorts of insects and the bees, and probably some rabbits.
It's a step towards establishing a better, more stable system.
It's about finding balance.
That's what we're trying to do here.
Find a balance.
Can humanity globally find a new balance between wild plants and those we have domesticated?
Around half the usable land on Earth is taken up by agriculture.
Do we really need that much?
Maybe not.
It's a remarkable fact, but around 80% of all cultivated land is used for raising livestock for us to eat.
Raising animals can be a sustainable way to create food, but in many places, plants can produce the same amount of protein on a fraction of the land that animals need.
What could it mean for wild plants if the global balance between plant-eating and meat-eating shifted?
It may sound odd, but the more plants we eat, the more space there will be for wild plants.
Remarkably, it's possible to restock even highly degraded land with wild plants.
In Brazil, the needs of cattle ranching drive most deforestation.
30 years ago, the owners of one former cattle ranch wanted to restore their land to the Atlantic rainforest that once covered it.
They had no idea if it could be done the land was so bare and eroded.
But they were determined to try.
First, they cleared the introduced African cattle grasses, invasive plants that outcompete most of the native plants.
The grasses were replaced by seedlings grown from seeds gathered in nearby remnants of Atlantic rainforest.
The Earth Institute, or Instituto Terra, as the ranch is known now, was encouraged by early success and expanded its scope and ambition.
In five years, trees covered the land again, and within ten, it was clear something remarkable was happening.
When rain falls, it now no longer simply runs off the land, leaving it parched.
Instead, it clings to the plants, to every root, stem and leaf and then slowly filters to the forest floor.
And, so, previously dry streams burst into life for the first time in decades.
The Institute never introduced animals or plants other than the trees.
The animals came back on their own.
Small ones came first.
And then, very recently, camera traps left in the forest captured images beyond the hopes of everyone involved.
A maned wolf, an animal that is being driven from its native habitat by deforestation, drawn to its favourite plant, the wolf fruit tree.
Not only that a puma with cubs!
The arrival of these precious top predators and their young shows what can happen when we make space for wild plants.
We have, for centuries, robbed wild plants of the space and time they need to thrive.
That has certainly not been to their benefit.
Nor, ultimately, is it to ours.
Our relationship with plants has changed throughout history, and now it must change again.
Whether it's what we eat and cultivate or whether it's what we like, we must now work with plants and make the world a little greener, a little wilder.
If we do this, our future will be healthier and safer and, in my experience, at any rate, happier.
Plants are, after all, our most ancient allies, and, together, we can make this an even greener planet.
Throughout the Human episode, the Green Planet crew sought to capture the lives of plants confronted with the human world.
But they also heard the stories of people deeply connected to the plants around them such as those at the front line of the battle to save Hawaii's native endangered plants from invasive species.
If we don't get a handle on Miconia, we could lose everything that makes Hawaii special and unique.
But before the Green Planet team could start work, they had to undertake some rigorous preparation.
We're going into somewhere.
It's a very sensitive ecosystem.
They're trying to protect it from invasives.
Filming in a place so ravaged by invasive species meant they had to be 100% sure that they were not spreading any non-native stowaways themselves.
They had to scrub and disinfect every item of equipment.
With kit clean, the team first focus on filming the rare holokea plant accessible only on foot.
There are a few pristine areas like this left in Hawaii, only 40% of the land still has native vegetation, most of it wiped out by invasive species like Miconia.
Next on the list was to film the team waging war on Miconia, known locally as the purple plague.
For crew member Aja, the work is not just a physical battle against this invasive species, it's deeply personal.
I've been to the pristine areas, so I know what it looks like and feels like, to be in the presence of all that mana and spirituality.
Those aren't just plants.
Those are ancestors' spirits.
Controlling these invasive plants is a relentless job, and Aja is not just doing this for native Hawaiian ecosystems, but also to protect her ancestral relationship to this fragile landscape.
So, going through this, it feels good to hack them and pull them out and be like, "Yeah, OK, take that!" You know.
We can sort of fight back.
Aja's fierce passion to protect these native forests is evident, but the purple plague has spread to places Aja could never reach on foot.
Taking to the sky is the only way to reach the front line of this battleground.
With only enough fuel to stay airborne for two hours, the window for capturing this aerial battle is uncomfortably small.
We have one day of doing the heli operations.
The weather could completely mess us up if we get a system that comes in, heli to heli is always dangerous and difficult.
This flight is not just tense for Liz, for plant sniper Brooke Mahnken, these short flights represent his only opportunity to hold back the invasion.
Miconia left unchecked can be terribly damaging.
The potential for one seeding plant, if it were to get far away from the population, reach maturity and put seeds out, then it's starting a whole new infestation.
And once it occupies that entire area, then it's completely wiped it out.
The helicopter is really important because you can fly in extreme terrain with these, like, 1,000ft cliffs and find Miconia that there would be no other way to get to these plants.
The Miconia team are used to the aerial challenges of this battle, but for producer Liz, the pre-fight talk from the helicopter pilot brings home the lengths that this team go to in order to complete their work.
You're just going to be in the back here and it's a hurricane in the back seat, literally a hurricane, so nothing loose, you don't want to put an arm ahead, a leg or a hand out because it's going to blow behind you and you don't want to stick your head out because if the headset comes off, then it's into the tail rotor and then it's bye-bye, Maui.
Pre-flight checks completed, the clock is now ticking to get into the air.
This matters so much to everyone here.
I definitely feel the pressure to get this right.
The first thing to do is shoot close-up shots at plants.
Because that's the hardest thing.
Let's look for some plants.
To get within shooting distance of the plants, the helicopter pilot must carefully manoeuvre in to one of the area's deepest canyons.
See the light-coloured rock? Yep.
Follow that up, to the right.
The target is in sight.
Oh, yeah. There it is.
OK, I'm live and ready.
With high winds gusting up from the waterfall, getting into position is tricky enough in one helicopter, let alone two.
To give Brooke the best chance of hitting the Miconia, the pilot must get him within 20 metres of the plant and ideally at eye-level.
Any missed shot threatens to become friendly fire, harming the species he aims to protect.
Ready? Yeah. Here we go.
Brooke must strike the stem of the plant to have the best chance of completely killing it.
Whoa! My God, nice fire!
Yeah, worked really well. Thanks, guys.
This has been a successful mission for both teams.
The pilot's skills and Brooke's sharp shooting has saved another patch of forest, and Liz is relieved that she has the shots she needs to do the story justice.
It's over. It's over.
It just looked amazing.
Yeah, it looks good.
It looks good.
For Brooke and Aja, however, their work doesn't stop.
Just holding back the tide of invasive species in Hawaii is more than a lifetime's work.
But Aja believes that her fight is worthwhile.
Everything we do is for the next generation, just like our ancestors and kupuna.
It wasn't for them, it was for the next generation.
And just to have my kids go into areas, like, where they can see there are still natives, where we don't have to go through all this invasive vegetation.
You know, it's not just my responsibility, it's everyone's responsibility.
The Earth takes care of us, so we have to do the same, we can't just let it go by.
We've got to take care, too.
The Open University had produced a poster that explores the vital role that plants have for our planet.

Mom.
Mom, turn around!
Mom, turn around! You're on Totally Hidden Video!
Say hi. Scream!
We've got a house full of company. Can we call you back Okay.
Hello. What's your name, sir?
"You're on Candid Camera."
Look at that little camera hidden in that corner behind the cabinet.
- Aren't you too close right now? - Yes, that's a camera.
- I'm not focused, Rachel. - Scream.
-Five cans of water! Holy-moly! -Five cans of water.
Rachel, this is gonna be such a boring tape, watching somebody put five cans of water in a pitcher.
Okay, Mom, Dad, can you introduce yourselves?
-You start. -Okay.
I'm Karen Mason.
I'm Barry Mason.
And we own Circus of Books, since 1982, so 33 years ago.
Which is a long time to do anything.
Can you say what the Circus of Books is?
All right. So, Josh, can you describe our family for me?
Like, what are Mom and Dad like?
I think our family There's a level of conventionality in our family. I think, we're a normal, tight-knit family.
I just mean to take us.
Hey, Micah, stop it. Micah! Come on.
We were striving for the perfect family look.
Micah, you moved.
Mom, she's definitely the alpha woman but still quite soft around the edges.
Oh, Hanukkah Come light the menorah.
Do it again.
She is strong-willed, and she goes for what she wants with force.
How would you describe Dad?
Don't bang into the bars.
Dad is one of the few people whose default state is happiness.
He's just kind of a happy guy.
What does the red light in this thing mean?
-Daddy, can I go in here? -Yeah.
Daddy!
The description is always, look for the bald guy with a smile on his face, whenever he was lost in a shopping mall.
It was definitely a good cop/bad cop duo.
Here I was, I would never call myself a soccer mom, but I was certainly a working mother with three children.
We didn't want them to know what we did at all, because we thought maybe people wouldn't, like, play with them.
I think that's a very tough piata.
We never talked about it.
It was just known that's how the family worked.
You don't talk about family business in the family.
If anyone asked us what our parents did, the official answer was, "Run a bookstore."
"We own a bookstore."
That's what you tell people.
There were times we had to get to the store, because Mom was driving us home and needed to stop by.
We were under strict instructions to stare down at the ground the entire time we were passing through certain areas of the store.
"Don't look around. Look at the floor."
But obviously wandering eyes.
There was one time I found a VHS tape in the back of Mom's car, and I grabbed it, and hid it, and waited for months.
Finally, everybody was out of the house, and I run to my hiding place, and I pull out this tape and it turns out it was a Beta, and I couldn't watch it.
So, Circus of Books is a bookstore and a hardcore gay, adult business.
I would always see Circus of Books, and I thought it was just a bookstore with a circus theme.
And I went in and realized that it was so much more than just a regular bookstore.
It had this whole section that was just, like, porn, P-O-R-N, you know.
It was great.
A purveyor of gourmet sexual material for every pervert in America, that was Circus bookstore's claim to fame.
It made all these men comfortable exploring their own sexuality.
Circus of Books was a safe place to find other gays.
There was cruising going on in the book stacks.
It was the center of the gay universe in that neighborhood.
A regular feature here on 2 on the Town is to take a look at some of the famous and infamous streets of Southern California.
And tonight, Lou Lauren takes us along with him to Santa Monica Boulevard.
This is the face of Santa Monica Boulevard that is familiar to most outsiders.
But the street also has a private side, perceived by outsiders only if it dawns on them that almost all of the people they see here are men.
In the first year I moved to Los Angeles, I found a place that was accepting.
West Hollywood was mainly very young, gay people, and it was called Boystown.
Back then, if you were out, you were an outlaw, and you did outlandish things?
That whole, like, toe-tapping, and cruising, and like, bandannas and flagging.
People don't say maybe I'd better get into a corner.
My boss might see me here?
No,I think gay liberation is here, and there's no problem at all.
My name is Alexei Romanoff, and I happen to be one of the last people who are still alive from the demonstration at the Black Cat.
On New Year's Eve, 1966, there were police raids on two of the bars.
Two or three seconds after midnight, after the song "Auld Lang Syne" was playing at the Black Cat, the police started to arrest people who were kissing.
They were afraid, because if they got outed, they could lose their job, lose their homes.
From that incident, came demonstrations against police brutality outside of the oldest gay bars in Los Angeles, the Black Cat and the New Faces.
It was the largest demonstration in the country at the time, and it was two and a half years before Stonewall.
The New Faces became the Circus of Books.
That bookstore was really important, because there was literature in them that had to do with our lives.
I mean, we were the unspoken, hidden people that you never talked about because they were disgusting.
I can't even explain how different it was.
To be a homo was unspeakable, basically.
Porn has always had a place in the gay community, because we didn't see anything like that.
To see men,naked and unafraid that gave us a lot of pride.
Circus of Books was my first glimpse into the fact that I wasn't alone as a gay person.
Being gay back then was not easy, and this bookstore, it kept me safe. It kept me out of harm's way.
How are the sales today?
They're on the slow side.
Then up.
Like every day,yeah?
Looks like some of the VHS might have sold, yeah?
- Yeah. - Did it?
- Yep. - Somewhat, yeah.
I mean, I just see this this morning.
Somebody brought in straight VHS tapes, and these are in really good condition.
I don't know who's gonna buy the straight VHS tapes, but we didn't pay anything.
We traded for books that we sell for a dollar.
These are pills. These are called cock rings.
Why is this going over there?
I don't know why this is going over there.
All right.
We got a report of a rat.
So one of the employees this morning happened to see it way back here where there is no food, but we just want to catch it before he decides to go up front and grab some of our snacks.
The front of the store has our most merchandise.
So this guy here, Handjobs magazine, just stopped publishing.
Now, he does organic chicken farming.
So when I order from him, we catch up on his chickens.
Okay, so this is our adult section.
Famous.
So, this is one of our best sections of all.
This is called "Previously Viewed,"
and these are hardcore gay DVDs that customers bought from us over the years.
I don't know that this is one of the really good ones.
For a while, we were just doing buy-one-get-one-free with this sale.
It's called Nude and Rude, directed by Carl Stanyon.
But even at $3.95, they're not flying off the shelves.
Some days, I go to work, and I feel like I'm just moving the deckchairs on the Titanic.
I take a seven-dollar movie and reduce it to three dollars, and I move it from this side of the wall to that side of the wall.
We're just an aging, ailing business.
She set off to be a journalist, so she did not set off to go chart a different course.
But I guess circumstances changed her from that path.
But if you look at Mom's early reporting, she interviewed Larry Flynt. She wrote about smut raids in bookstores.
- Really? -Yes.
-That was her early reporting? - Yes.
I had no idea.
Me neither until I found her articles.
This was our little staff in Dayton.
Whoa! You dressed kind of sexy actually.
Yeah, I did. I had a nice figure. Look at that.
What?
-Yeah. -What?
See, but, Rachel, what are you gonna do with stuff like this?
I mean, this is just stuff that I happened to be involved in.
Okay,you're not somebody that makes documentaries.
Neither are you.
If you want to take it and make a collage.
Mom, I don't know what I'm gonna do with it.
Just stop criticizing every little possible turn of events.
I want to find that Flynt article.
Look at this.
"Six arrested in smut raids."
So, this could be the judicial system moved with unusual speed Friday in the cases of six men charged with selling obscene material in downtown Cincinnati adult book stores.
Karen and I met in high school.
She was outgoing, inquisitive, interested in everything.
Karen always wanted to be a reporter.
My first real newspaper job was at the Wall Street Journal in Chicago.
And then I got hired at the Cincinnati Enquirer.
The editor has arrived.
It's a start of a typical work day at the newspaper.
I specialized in criminal justice.
My special project was to interview a Supreme Court Justice named Potter Stewart, who's particularly well-known for his obscenity decision, which said, I can't really describe obscenity, but I know it when I see it.
I interviewed Larry Flynt for a series on these Hustler bars.
I'm a very unlikely person to be in this, because if I hadn't have ran away from home when I was 12 years old, I'd still be looking a mule up the ass.
It was clear that he had a pretty big concept, and it looked like he was gonna be pretty successful.
What was happening in that picture where you are looking around a car?
There was somebody in a house, and they were trying to get him out, and I think shots were fired.
She always wanted more exciting stories.
She likes things to be hard.
I never expected to be burned out of journalism, but a good newspaper story is very often somebody's tragedy.
I covered plane crashes. I covered murders.
I covered car accidents.
At some point, you either get very jaded, or you say, "That's enough."
I came out to LA to visit my parents, thinking I was gonna go to Alaska and be a freelance writer.
I never went to Alaska, and I never did anything with freelance journalism.
And is that when you met?
We met at a Jewish singles party in Woodland Hills.
It was pretty dark. I don't know why it started so late.
As I got to the party, there were some women leaving, and they said this is terrible party.
Why don't you come with us?
I said, "Well, I drove all this way. I think I'll stay for a bit."
I just happened to notice the light from the end of a cigarette.
I said, "That looks like it might be a girl up there."
He came over to me, and we just started talking.
It was a very interesting conversation.
The whole time, I couldn't see her.
I mean, I couldn't see her face. It was so dark.
He suggested we go for coffee.
When she walked in, that's first time I saw her.
She looked fine to me.
And then, from then on, we just went out all the time.
He had a motorcycle.
Mother wasn't crazy about that.
And we got married in seven months.
I had a blue dress.
He had a jacket that we paid five dollars for.
-It was on sale. -Yeah.
A lot of stripes, colored stripes.
I remember she said he's this kind of genius, inventing gizmos.
I started in UCLA's Motion Picture Department.
Jim Morrison and his friend Ray Manzarek, those two hung around together.
And since we were all in the same department, we shot movies together.
But what happened?
How come my parents, or the state, or the university didn't look ahead?
I got my first job in the movies with Linwood Dunn.
When I first got to work with him, we were just finishing up special effects for 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Light it up. Okay, lights up, gentlemen.
And then Star Trek came along, and we did that for three years.
They used these optical printers.
That was a very common thing in special effects.
And since I knew a lot about color and light, I invented an accessory for dialysis machines.
We have to back up and say his father was a kidney patient.
Okay. So, I invented things for him and then you have to say why. In those days, Barry trained running his father's blood through the machine.
The first night he was home, a tube broke, and he could have died.
Yeah, he could have died.
I said, "There's no reason I can't make a little detector that would detect when the tubing turned red instead of white."
And so I figured out a way to do that.
So you actually just applied your special effects technology skills to medical devices, and you had no experience with that?
Yeah.
The technician who had trained me calls me, and he says, hey, Barry, you gotta quit your job.
Your thing works so good that I went out, and I showed it to a company who makes actual kidney machines, and they're gonna order 325 of these.
We made a very modest living as an inventor of dialysis equipment.
But then malpractice insurance went up $35,000.
At that time, that's about what I was making.
These doctors, they said, "if you can't afford the insurance, we're out."
We were not in a good place at all.
We were starting a family and needed to make a living somehow.
The basic unit of society is the family.
And if you destroy that, you destroy society.
And I'm firmly convinced that pornography, obscenity attacks the family.
I decided a long time ago. If you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly.
I'm not rolling over and playing dead for him or any other prosecutor in America, because this country belongs to me as much as it belongs to them.
I spent most of the '70s and '80s putting out censorship fires all over the country.
-Hi. It's so good to see you. - How you doing?
You put out an ad in the L.A. Times looking for small distributors.
Well, because the establishment distributors would not distribute the magazine.
So I went direct to a lot of bookstores and secondary distributors.
The very day after I sold all our rights to these machines, Karen came in. I hadn't woke up yet.
And she shows me a full-page ad from Larry Flynt that says he's looking for distributors.
It was just something else he could do, because we didn't have anything to do.
I was sleeping late, because I didn't have anything to do that morning until she woke me up with the ad.
I spoke to a woman, and she said, "You just need to send us an order for 2,500 magazines,"
and they would put us on as a distributor as long as we had a truck.
And so, I said,I had a truck.
Of course, I didn't, but I could rent a truck.
You don't have the luxury of not earning a living.
You have to figure out what you're gonna do.
Barry took our little station wagon out to the liquor stores in our area.
I would say, "If you can't get it from your regular distributor, would you buy it from me?"
And at the end of the day, I had 2,500 orders.
Your mom and dad were one of our very first distributors in this area.
And they grew, and they did very well.
I told Karen this was so easy.
Why don't I just see if I can get more customers?
We made enough money that we could just function while we figured out what we were gonna do.
Meanwhile, Flynt took over other magazine companies.
So we had several gay titles.
Blueboy was one of the first really successful gay publications that was not underground.
They had trouble finding a distributor, and they came to me.
Then he got other ones, Honcho and Mandate, which were all the top gay magazines at the time.
We had even thousands of titles knitting magazines, woodworking, guns, you name it.
- New York Review of Books. - Yeah, but fine, good magazines.
We would try and get the better magazines, and they sold it to us. What do you mean "better"?
-Like New York Review of Books. - No.
The New York Review of Books never sold very well.
What sold well was Hustler.
I remember hearing that Barry was distributing Hustler magazine, and Circus of Books, or Book Circus, was on his route.
The store was taking 600 of all the gay titles.
I mean, I would load the whole truck up just for them.
Book Circus was not paying their bills very well.
And so, Barry saw an opportunity and pounced.
When he stopped paying, I ran into his manager.
He says He's become a terrible cocaine addict, and he's not paying anybody.
I got the idea to call the landlord and offer him half the rent.
So then, we actually were in business, and there was no more problems, other than the old owner threatened to kill me one day, but that didn't happen fortunately.
There was this big, fluorescent sign. It said, "Book Circus,"
and we had to rename it.
I said you know we could just cut that sign right in half, and flop the words around, and just pay for "of," and I didn't know that you switched the sign.
I mean, that's kind of like our whole philosophy of retail.
How can we do this cheap? Because it may not work.
I mean, if you look at the store, it's all kind of falling apart now.
Don't Drop the Soap. Let me see what it says about that one.
What are you looking for?
I'm just trying to find something that isn't quite as explicit.
What does he want?
He wants a white man and no penetration, he said.
Do these guys look white to you, Jorge?
Okay, good.
Okay, so we'll take this one.
Do these guys look white?
See, all these boxes are full of DVDs.
We made all the titles in this list here.
-You guys made all of those? - Yeah, those sent you to college.
These are the videos that sent me to college?
They certainly helped.
What year were most of these made?
You can't photograph those model releases.
Mom, I'm just photographing the title names.
Okay, you gotta stop filming, Rachel.
Now, Mom?
So, where we're going now is something Expo. ANME, yeah.
And then I'm not going to this ever again. It's the last time.
Why?
Because I don't like it.
She said we're gonna meet in the lobby, but I don't know where the lobby is.
Can you just stop for one second?So I can put this mic on you.
You can't just keep telling me what I can and can't do.
I run a little business, and I don't usually have to answer to people.
- Ellen's here. -Hey, Ellen.
I brought you an order.
Excuse me.
Yeah,This is a bigger camera than last time.
I didn't wanna poke myself in the head.
Okay, this is an order.
-Okay? - Okay.
What kind of a special do you have this time?
- I got a big special for you. - Okay.
This gets rid of herpes, destroys herpes.
Just give us the stuff we always sell.
We're not doing good with new stuff.
The other thing that I have that everybody likes, it's the lube, is the anal lube.
-Which one is that?-It's this one.
I mean, it's doing really well. It's our silicone.
It's anal lube. It's silicone.
It's got clove in it, so it's kinda numbing.
So it's not gonna tear.
-Okay, but do you have a smaller size? - Yeah.
-Okay, so send me, like, 12. - It comes in a fishbowl.
Okay, all right.
- You want a fishbowl? - Yeah.
-Okay, so just add that. - I'll do that.
Okay, that's a nice order, Ellen.
We're placing an order for those pills from China.
I guess you only have 200 left.
We got lots. I bought lots. We received a lot.
Okay, is that still selling okay? Because hello.
-How are you? - Okay.
-Good to see you. How's everything - Okay.
Yeah?
How's Barry doing?
He's good, yeah.
What happened to Frankie?
-Are you Circus of Books in LA? - Yeah.
I've been to your stores.
- You're the owner? - Yeah.
- Whoa! Good for you! - Yeah.
Hello.
All right, so what do you have besides a good name?
Yeah, this is gay, right?
-Or not necessarily? -Not necessarily.
- Clamps - Okay.
Don't explain anything to me.
If it's not for gay, then that's the reason we didn't do any business.
What's something that would do well for you?
Here, like this whole wall of stuff.
But I don't particularly enjoy looking at it, so I can notice it without looking at it.
So, this wall would probably do well for us, whatever it is.
-That's it. Now, can we go? - Yeah.
We hired the people who ran the store for the old owners, and they really taught us what we needed to know about how to get the merchandise, which was the key to the whole thing.
I'm one of the buyers for the condoms, the lubricants, and some of the sale video.
They pretty much let me decide.
If I make mistakes, it's no big deal.
Karen and Barry were the absolute best.
They were so good to me.
It was always my dream to work in a porn store.
I'm a weirdo and kind of a pervert, I guess.
The heyday of this place was really, really jamming.
People spent money on books, magazines, whatever they wanted to.
Within the month, we opened, and the first day, the store did over $1,000.
You got your magazines on that side of the store, and your real graphic, adult magazines were on this side.
There was an alley behind Circus of Books called Vaseline Alley.
Every community that has a big gay population has a Vaseline Alley.
It was a place where gay sex happens.
I lost my virginity in the alley behind Circus of Books with a cop in training.
I mean, this was, like, every queer boy's wet dream.
My first night here, there's this guy in that corner this is not even on the adult side.
With his pants down, stroking.
And I'm like, "Son of a bitch! My first night here, and this happens."
You could walk back to the back room, and there were some steps to the attic, and I had sex in the attic.
Not full-on sex in the attic, but I've never even been up there.
I didn't even know that existed.
I missed out, man.
Did you ever hear about any of that stuff?
I heard about it, but I didn't think they were so crazy.
The whole operation was a little goofy, so it would have to be something incredible for me to find it really crazy.
When Barry walked in, you didn't change.
You still continued reading a magazine.
"Hey, Barry, how's it going?"
When Karen walked in, phew, that magazine flew to the back.
Your dad has always been the very mellow one.
He's not the one that wears the pants in the family.
I shouldn't say that on camera.
They were very, like, no-bullshit, no-nonsense.
"If you steal from us, you will be fired, and that's that."
In the '80s, adult material was expensive, and it was illegal in some places, and if you could sell it, you could make a lot of money.
A manager said to us, you should open a Circus of Books in Silver Lake, and this will become your biggest store," and it did.
They're not offended. They're not scandalized.
It's their job.
It's like they're selling apples at an apple cart.
I don't think we had any misgivings about doing it.
We just felt it was gonna be a very temporary thing until something came along that was, more substantial.
Because we're college graduates, and we had careers.
That was, like, not anything anyone would do, and we certainly wouldn't tell anyone we were doing it.
So then what led you to start making the adult movies?
This way just a tad. There you go. Yeah, that's it.
Somebody knew a very famous hardcore gay movie producer, Matt Sterling.
He was looking for a legitimate distributor who he could trust.
And he was coming out with this new movie, which no doubt was gonna be a hit, because it was also gonna star that, at that time, very famous.
-Jeff Stryker. -Jeff Stryker.
-Who was already famous. - Who was very famous.
I mean, Jeff Stryker was, like, a superstar of gay porn.
He was one of the biggest.
No pun intended.
Are you willing to give me whatever I want?
Anything.
Hello. My name is Jeff Stryker, and here I am.
This is the Jeff Stryker action figure.
It's 12 inches tall, anatomically correct, and the penis is pose-able.
That's what I got over an edge on Ken.
You would never expect these people to be distributing adult movies worldwide, but they looked at it the same way I looked at it.
You're creating a product, and it's the supply and demand.
It's just business sense.
It was strictly an opportunity.
So we started a business, that made hardcore gay films.
They made Stryker Force, and it was hard to keep up with the demand.
People were calling us and insisting we ship them the tape already.
I said, "I don't even have it yet. I can't ship it to you."
It was like a panic to get this tape.
In fact, we had him at our store signing the tapes, and there's a big line of customers.
Barry would bring stack after stack of these boxes, and I would sign as long as they could supply them.
Other people, when they knew we were distributing, they would come to us too and say, "Would you do ours?"
Of course, by then, we'd hired another fellow to sell the tapes.
Barry and Karen were behind the scenes, they wanted somebody like me to be their front man for them.
When we first started, we might have been releasing one movie every six weeks.
And somewhere in the middle of that, we were releasing two movies a week.
It was like riding a tiger, we used to say.
So many companies wanted to do business with them because they're good, honest, trustworthy people, and in the adult industry, that was a rare bird at the time.
This is one of the compilations I made for Barry and Karen.
It's called Rimnastics Gold Part 2.
Video 10 Distributors has uncovered even more hot rimming scenes to bring you Rimnastics Gold Part 2.
It's more than fantastic. Its rim-tastic.
Sorry. Oh, my God!
It never felt like we were getting into pornography.
We were just getting into a different business that was related to the business we were already in.
We never saw any of those movies.
At one point, we were probably the biggest distributor of hardcore gay films in the United States.
It was a very lucrative market, but you really took major chances, major chances of imprisonment in any part of the adult movies.
Adult material, especially at that time,was a pretty polarizing thing.
There were always people on the right who looked out for things they could demonize.
Obscene publications are socially harmful.
The Department of Justice says that pornography is a problem that pervades all levels of society.
Should therefore be solved by all levels of government.
Their anti-porn plan is expected to involve state and local participation.
This was led by Meese, the Attorney General for Ronald Reagan.
This administration is putting the purveyors of illegal obscenity on notice.
I never felt free to let anybody know what we did.
I don't think you would have cared, but I didn't want it.
Right, I just didn't talk because she didn't want me to.
She preferred that I not tell people.
If you went somewhere, and you said,"Well, I own Circus of Books,"
people would say to you, "Oh, I don't have any problem with that."
So, it was like you were being judged.
I mean, you don't go up to somebody when they say they're a teacher and say, "I don't have any problem with that."
Or, "I'm a lawyer." "I don't have any problem with that."
But they would say that to us. "I don't have any problem with that."
And they probably did have a problem with that. I had a problem with that.
Karen's problem with the whole sexually-explicit inventory, a lot of it, I think, has to do with her faith.
She was raised in a conservative household.
She loves to be in synagogue all day praying.
I always say we're a mixed marriage, because I'm the religious person, and he's not.
He doesn't particularly like anything very spiritual, I don't think.
- Pretty accurate. - Yeah.
We've always belonged to a synagogue.
Although, the synagogues never knew what we were doing.
She was very afraid that the business, if it got out, would impact those relationships.
Do you feel like we had a lot of, like, religious education.
So, I feel it was really complicated.
Mom was kind of caught between this stuffy, conservative synagogue.
But that's what she was born with.
And we growing up in West Hollywood, which is just really secular and liberal.
So, I feel like it was kind of forced on us and not in a soft way.
Mom's usual force of nature, "You are going to Sunday school" kind of way.
Just go ahead. You have the Torah out. You have to be respectful.
Now, come on.Come back here and find your spot.
Find your spot.
My reaction to a lot of the pressure was to be quiet.
I know you fought with Mom a lot because you wouldn't dress the way she wanted you to.
Definitely did your own thing.
But I'm guessing Josh's reaction was, "Fine, I'm doing what I'm gonna do, and I'm gonna do it perfect."
I think I absorbed the most of Mom's ambition towards perfection.
I was always looking to give a positive image to them, to everyone else.
Use your power! Kick the thing!
Just spread out, Joshua. All right!
Get the ball!
I wanted to be perfect.
Do you remember writing this book when you were a kid?
It's called Boy by Joshua Mason.
In the future, my family would consist of my beautiful wife, me, and my three kids.
I would live in a world so close to heaven it would be unreal.
Oh, my God!
I distinctly remember "gay" being a bad word.
It was one of those words that you used about bad things.
I definitely perceived that it was wrong.
All right.
Keys for her store.
Tom's gonna pull another 100 today.
And over the weekend.
This used to be ten times more than this.
I know. It seems like it's hardly any now.
That's it. There's still a lot, but it's not nearly as much as it used to be.
Yeah. Did you know many of the people in these films?
I know some of the more famous ones.
The Matt Sterling one, that was a very famous one, and Jeff Stryker, he was a very famous guy.
-What happened to Matt Sterling? - Died. He died.
Yeah, I know a lot of the producers of them.
How many people would you think died in a lot of these movies?
A lot. When AIDS was going around, a lot of them died then.
How old were a lot of them Like, what would the average age be?
In their 20s and 30s maybe.
Those would be the ones I would see in the hospice, those guys I knew.
But a lot of them didn't do that. I didn't even know.
They would just go home, maybe back to Wisconsin or wherever they were from, and that was it.
Barry and Karen enjoyed a strange, freakish vantage point to bear witness to the epidemic without being part of it.
I mean, my God! They ran a sex business.
That was the locus of the population of the people that were dying.
Nobody knew what it was caused from at first, and people were avoiding each other.
We just didn't understand it.
We were afraid of each other.
More than 800 cases nationwide, and yet still surprisingly few people are familiar with the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
The reason for that may lie in part in the character of its most common victims, homosexual males who frequently change sexual partners.
We lost so many of our employees, and nice people. I mean really nice people.
Talented, bright, young.
It was a real tragedy.
Ninety percent of the people I knew at that time are no longer here.
I remember Barry visiting an employee who was in bed.
We would call the parents and say hey, your son is sick.
Don't you wanna come and A lot of them would just say no, I don't.
I kicked him out. I never wanna see the guy again.
I'd say, "But he's your son."
I was just so surprised that the parents could be so bad to their children.
And I didn't think about the gay part of it.
It was just their children.
The employee who worked so closely with us to open that store went home on a Friday and died on Monday.
We were working with him until literally, until he passed away.
And I remember taking a call from his mother after he died.
She wasn't in touch with him during that period, and I think she was feeling bad. I don't know what she wanted from me.
But she should have visited him.
- It was a horrible, horrible time. - Yeah, really bad time.
I remember going to the store and being like, "where's so-and-so" "he just died."
Something seemed like a horror about that to me, but I didn't understand it till much later.
I know they supported the gay community.
I mean, they didn't set out to, but they did.
They were not gonna let other forces tell them what to do.
I think what we did was small, human kindnesses in a very small way.
Government officials will very often use pornography as a means of deflecting attention away from their failures to do something.
Attorney General Meese accepted the pornography report today.
Obscenity, that illegal activity, it is not the kind of thing that is subject to the protection of the First Amendment.
When that Meese commission was on, I would read about it all the time, and it was a totally stacked deck.
Everybody that testified was anti-pornography people.
So, the outcome was absolutely assured. They were just gonna say it was no good.
Opponents say the commission is using a half-million dollar report to moralize.
The government is attempting to obtain self-censorship by the threat of these draconian sanctions.
They had a multi-million dollar task force with all the money they needed with one mission, to control people's reading and viewing habits and their sexual habits if they could.
Isn't it about time we remove the profit motive from activities that are sick and obscene.
One of the things you did in those days, was you only sold movies to people you knew.
So, we sold movies all over the country, but only to companies we'd been dealing with.
One day, somebody called up and ordered three films to, like, Joe's Video Store, in Lebanon, Pennsylvania.
And our guy entered him in the computer and shipped them out.
Unbeknownst to us, the prosecutor begins this process of illegal transportation of adult material over state lines.
They were running a sting operation.
The FBI comes in, like you see on television with FBI on their jackets. Big letters. jackets, and their guns drawn.
We made some undercover purchases of this stuff, and after consultation with the Prosecuting Attorney, they issued us a search warrant.
We were charged with shipping obscene material.
It easily could have been a five-year jail sentence or maybe more, and the fines could have been very large.
One of us was gonna have to go to jail, and I thought it had better be Barry.
That lead prosecutor had put together a staff of very religious people, and he himself was very anti-porn.
So they said Barry has to enter a guilty plea.
He has to be convicted and made guilty of a felony.
Jail is the worst place in the world you can be, but fearing jail is even worse.
It was like a knife over our heads all the time.
We never ever talked about it with anybody.
Our parents didn't know what was going on.
The kids didn't know what was going on.
Our friends didn't know what was going on.
I felt like I was going down in an elevator and was losing everything that was inside of me.
Did you know about the FBI charges?
I didn't know about the prosecution.
I think I'd heard something about a video being mailed to Pennsylvania.
They completely hid that from us growing up.
I don't remember knowing about that at all.
We just were completely kept in the dark because we were kids, and we're not supposed to be anywhere near that stuff.
So because of that, I didn't have much of a connection to the business.
Did you feel any connection to the store?
I think the store definitely operated in its own sphere outside the family, there's a conventional element to that.
Parents go to work.
They don't necessarily talk about what they do all the time.
Stop rubbing your eyes!
I think the family at home fell into a conventional pattern.
-Did Josh say that to you? - Really?
Yeah, he did.
We all talked about kids, getting married, and being straight.
Nobody sort of questioned it.
I think even my understanding of gays and gay life was through through the business in a strange way.
And I would like to say, you've been a pretty good kid.
I really like being your mother.
Realizing I was gay was a kind of long, ambiguous period.
I was keeping that secret from the world because being gay was not acceptable.
But did you ever know or see people that just were gay, like, and that you recognized and like that's gay.
-That's cool. That's like. - No. Definitely not.
I think I was kind of actively ignoring all the gay issues in the world much like my straight high school friends.
You just didn't talk about gays or what it was like.
It was very archetypal, jocks picking on the gays.
Idiot!
I did what I could to keep myself out of the gay category, but I wasn't good enough to be heterosexual.
So I was just asexual as far as they were concerned.
I put a lot of pressure on myself to be the more conventional, rule-follower child.
You ready, Dad?
Whoa! Yeah!
I think I filled every available gap in the day with some sort of activity.
So I had diving, gymnastics team.
Did you feel like pressure to pretend that you were straight?
There was a lot of pressure towards dating.
There were kids that lost their virginity and stuff like that.
It's just so weird to me that you wouldn't have thought that I would have cared, right?
I mean, I didn't care. I wouldn't.
I mean, my world was gay anyway.
Why wouldn't you have wanted to jump into my world?
Your world was too gay.
Your world was too gay. It was too artsy.
I didn't connect with it.
That wasn't where I was.
It's not where I am, I don't think.
Fernando, can you tell me how we met?
We met in ninth grade.
At that time, you kind of recognized those people that were living to the beat of their own drum, I would say through hair, and clothes, and music.
And you were one of those people that had the whole package of what I was looking for in a friend, someone that just, again, walked to the beat of their own drum.
Always looking for attention!
Pssht!Nice coming from you, Miss Green.
Do you feel like our friend group identified as the queer group at school?
We didn't really identify as queer.
In the '90s, we identified as weirdos, artists, punk rockers, rebels.
That was our identity, and that's what drew us all together.
That's why it was so accepting for all of our friends to experiment with their sexuality.
Can I come over and like hang out with your computer?
Okay.
Do you remember when I found out about the store?
Yes.
You had said, "My parents own a bookstore."
And I said, "Oh, what bookstore do they own?"
You're just like, "They own a bookstore.
You probably never heard of it. It's called Circus of Books.
And we were like, "Circus of Books What"
"Rachel, Circus of Book is a porno store!"
I just remember being really confused because it didn't align with who I thought my parents were.
It was sort of an interesting, fun secret, but also kind of a dangerous secret, 'cause I could definitely tell it could easily be a problem.
As rebellious and as precocious as we were, we were still pretty innocent.
What's funny to me is that I didn't think my parents got my world with artists and queer kids.
But they were actually intersecting with my scene without me even realizing it.
Yeah, it felt like we had seen Karen and Barry one way, very parental and a little bit more strict.
Certainly not subversive, you know?
Certainly not part of the counterculture.
But when we realized they were invested in Circus of Books, it started to become clear to us your parents were more layered than we had previously thought.
It allowed us to realize that you can live as an adult without following the path that everyone's telling you you need to follow.
I think that when your parents acquired their business, they really didn't know what they were potentially facing, and the terrible thing about it was that nobody could know.
There was no way to look at the obscenity statute and predict whether something that one was selling might trigger a prosecution.
We knew people who had been in this business and had gone to jail.
But what I thought initially was, "We'll just go out of business,"
and when we finally sat down with John Weston, he said that is a terrible plan.
Government always wants its pound of flesh.
So, if at the very beginning of something, you close it down, then you've got less to offer.
If the war on drugs ever goes away, all these people who fight drugs are going to lose their jobs.
It was the same thing with people who fought obscenity.
They needed somebody to negotiate with, and so we were advised not to close at all, but to stay in business and fight.
I mean, it's scary when the government comes after you.
That is just really powerful and for basically religious reasons.
It's pretty scary stuff to me.
I got a communication from the government, saying, "We need Barry Mason to say, 'Guilty.'"
He has to be convicted and made guilty of a felony.
Just at a human level, the idea that Barry Mason should be a felon was just unacceptable.
I mean, that's just not part of any world that I'd wanna live in.
And so I implored them to reconsider.
To see who he was as a person, and what the impact on him, and his family, and to some extent, you, would have been if your dad had been forced to stand up in court and say, "Yes, I'm guilty. I've committed a federal felony."
The reason it was resolved was that Bill Clinton got elected.
The President of the United States, Bill Clinton.
All right.
Thank you.
So, the prosecutors got switched.
There was a different attitude towards obscenity, and I'm sure that created a climate which allowed my earnest request for reconsideration to be evaluated.
They were able to see the fineness of your dad.
They accepted the guilty plea by the corporation.
Corporation pleads guilty. They let you out on parole.
I had to just go down to the Federal building once a month, sign a little piece of paper that said I didn't commit any crimes that month, and then that ended the whole situation. I was off.
It turns out our First Amendment rights are really protected by the most extreme kind of speech and the most extreme kind of material.
The greatest right that any nation can afford its people is the right to be left alone.
Josh needs a perfectly round head.
Say hi.
So what did you just say?
So, in June, both stores had the worst month they've ever had.
And it's still profitable, but it's not, it's not sustainable.
At some point, it's just like yesterday.
I was leaving the store, and I'm trying to get out, and I can't, because the man there just bought something, and he's got a walker.
And he's sort of looking at what he bought, so he's not opening the door.
And because he's got the walker, he's stuck there.
And this is our customer base. They're aging, mostly men who can barely even walk.
Are you, like, mixing it in as a cereal?
Yeah, because otherwise, you can't eat the little pieces.
This way, I can eat all the pieces.
So, I think instead of a business decision, I have a psychology problem because I've run this business for all these years without knowing what I'm doing, and I need to close it, but I still got people working for me who won't get as good a job.
-That's cheese. - Cottage cheese, yeah.
-Cheese.
I don't know.
And I don't know why you think this is worth documenting.
Because, I mean, this happens in small business.
It's a different business model.
I don't like all this filming.
I don't know what you're gonna come up with from this.
Karen and Barry were in a constant state of panic about the collapse of their business.
And so, it was constantly like, this is it. We're closing the doors this week.
This is it. This is the end.
That was always the case.
So, that's why I'm sort of in disbelief about it closing.
I'm like, "Well, it was always about to close."
These are letters of reference.
It just says, "He's worked for us for over 25 years.
And if you need a good, honest, reliable, hard-working employee, you've found him in Ben.
-I'm so sorry, but good for you. - Thanks.
Today is my last day. I'm retiring.
So, I'd say it's kind of a depressor, but it's time.
The worst thing in the world is laying off a good employee because you can't afford to keep them anymore.
It's a terrible thing to do.
The past will never come back.
And unless you're willing to invest in the future, there's no use even trying to exist anymore.
As I'm sure you can see, business at the store is slowing down despite our best efforts to improve sales.
This is to let you know that I have listed the store for lease with a real estate agent.
I welcome any suggestion of new merchandise and any ideas for a different use of the space.
Post it here by the time clock.
Let me see.
They'll see it.
Can you describe that day that you came out to Mom and Dad, and what led you to feel that you could be more open about it?
What led you to really think that you should be?
It probably wasn't until after high school that it even started to enter my mind as an option.
And it wasn't really until college that I sort of started transitioning from, um, who I was outwardly towards who I felt like I was inwardly.
I came home a number of times from college expecting to come out, and it didn't happen.
I put a lot of pressure on myself to kind of make it happen.
I made sure I had my flight booked and paid for, because it wasn't an impossible thought that I was gonna get thrown out.
Yeah.
Are you okay?
Should I read the questions to myself?
No, I'm sorry. It's just upsetting to me to hear that.
Friday night dinner, just before he was going back to school at Columbia.
He was at one end of our dining room table, and I was at the other.
Someone was having a conversation that required a Post-It Note and a pen.
And I just started scribbling on the Post-It Note, "I'm gay."
I flung the pen and paper on the table.
And I'm trying to see who wrote this note, because it didn't have his name on it.
Finally, his mother and him went upstairs, and I said, "Wow! It's Josh."
I said, "Are you sure Why are you doing this?
God must be punishing me.
God would punish her for having this business, and I think she was thinking this was a punishment.
Up until that point, it had just existed somewhere outside any of my core values.
It wasn't something I really needed to think very hard about.
I was fine with anybody who was gay as far as I was concerned, but I really wasn't prepared to have a gay child.
I was actually expecting Dad to be more upset about it, just 'cause it's usually the dad that throws the gay son out of the house.
He was really good about it.
When he told us, I was just simply surprised.
The only thing that I was even slightly upset about was that he had kept it a secret, because it would have made absolutely no difference to me.
His plane was the next morning, so we didn't get a chance to talk much about it.
As we were driving to the airport, he said, "You know men can take advantage of other men just as much as men can take advantage of women."
Which I thought was actually quite astute.
Why do you think Mom had any issue whatsoever when she was so deeply in this world?
Everything about the business was really in support of family, ironically.
The gay part of it fell on the business side of that mental dividing line.
I never thought of my employees in the same way that I thought about my son.
I was fine working with gay people, but when it came to my own family and what I had absorbed in the religion, I was not fine at all.
When it came to my own son, I realized that I had some thoughts about gay people that needed to change.
I don't know why he didn't come, the trash.
What day does he come?
- I think Thursdays, but I can check. - Well, that's today.
Why were you saying that you wanna close in June?
If it's Sales are bad.
We're trying to keep our staff.
It seems, because the business is so slow, they're not even doing kind of minimal straightening.
So everybody's kind of done here.
So, goodbye to this box.
If I thought it was a viable business for anybody, then I would put it up for sale, but I don't think that anybody will be able to make it more than what we make it.
But it may go another year, say, or something.
Or not. It's hard to know.
Which is why I wish your movie was done, so I could see how it would end too. I would like that.
This is a statement about this business.
It kind of all ended up in the dumpster.
Here.
I just think it's kind of interesting.
That's like a sales, you know it tracks it.
Okay, so this is 2008, which is, like, the recession and also the Internet, and then you can just see it going down.
When people started selling on the Internet, we didn't.
We have a website, but it really doesn't sell anything.
It just tells people what we have and they come into our stores.
I've wondered how they could survive with the Internet, because porno was devastated.
You can't sell what people can get for free.
Pornography is pushing the limits online.
Sexually explicit material is increasingly available on the Internet.
The Internet totally devastated my business.
It robbed me of my income.
It also could be considered the death knell of the gay bar, because you don't need to go to a bar anymore to meet somebody.
You can meet them online.
In a lot of ways, the Internet has helped, because we don't have to live, like, in the shadows and so, like, oppressed and afraid anymore.
But I also think it's, I mean, it just sucks that the younger generation is so hard to just talk face-to-face with one another.
They weren't just places of commerce.
They were places of gathering where people could get together.
They were places where people could meet in all the best senses.
The material may be delivered, but it's not going to be a substitute for human interaction, and to the extent that's what's going on, I think that's a tragic and irreplaceable loss.
I don't think they're gonna want any of these papers.
I don't know what I'm giving them anymore.
It's been such a long time since I put this stuff in here.
- I've heard his name, though. - Yeah.
So, those are some of his covers.
He was really a nice guy.
I would like if he's not in ONE Archive, I think he would like to be in it, so I think you have to sign this.
-What? -It's a deed of gift.
Just basically saying that you're giving the materials.
-Right there. -Okay.
If you don't want it, just throw it away.
You don't know who you're talking to. We never throw anything away.
But whatever it is that you have, we're happy to look at it.
I don't think we have anything you want there.
But as long as I'm here, I'd just like to look at I just think this is really where it all started.
So, where the erotica was, or where the pulp fiction was, they would basically put it behind a big curtain.
So, there was the problem of being caught by the police, or there was, alternatively, the problem that the good problem, perhaps, that you could meet somebody else who was looking for the same material.
So, it was actually a really great thing to be able to go get them.
I remember going to Circus of Books, and it was a place where you could go and find other people like yourself.
The store served its purpose, and it's just not I'll be happy when it's closing.
Thank you for your donation. I really appreciate it.
It's just some stuff.
This is important, I think. Much more than our store, this is I mean, the courage that it took to put these out month after month.
They had to go in secret.
But can you imagine some kid in Iowa or someplace getting a copy of this and thinking, "God! I'm not the only one."
It's just amazing.
Should be doing the documentary about this.
When Josh came out, the next morning, we took him to the airport, and the rule was that when he got to his dorm, he had to call and say he got to his dorm.
And so we waited and waited, and he didn't call, and finally, I picked up the phone, and I said to him, no matter what you are, you still have to call your mother and say you got to your dorm.
It was much harder for me to then begin talking about it.
Karen did not, could not, tell any of her friends for a year.
I was sitting there in the congregation just trying to find how I was gonna get through this struggle that I had with who he was, my wonderful son.
The idea that he was homosexual was an abomination in our religion.
In a marriage like Daddy's and mine, the non-religious spouse has much less trouble accepting their homosexual child than the religious spouse.
Why didn't you ever just drop religion?
It's just not an option for me.
If your way of being in the world is to be religious, accepting God is just easier.
But being religious is not easy. You have to work at that, too.
I needed to rethink my theology in order to be okay with it.
I took Bible study classes.
What does the word "abomination" mean?
Why do they say that in relation to homosexuality?
And what were they really saying in the context of the time?
It was a long time of searching, and acceptance, and learning that there was a really profound group of thinkers, and leaders, and people who happened to be gay, and were forming these wonderful, vibrant communities.
We got involved with PFLAG, and she met other women that had similar experiences.
It's called Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, and it's a support group for people who need help understanding what gender issues are.
She really went through kind of a transformation after that.
I was not not gonna be his best mother that I could be.
Your children have their own path, and you can't direct it.
You can only take them the first few steps on their way.
But it sure took a lot of work to come around.
So we're gonna start with the Masons telling their story, and you would you like to go first, Karen?Since Barry went first the other time I think let Barry go first. He has the better story.
That'll compensate for you.
About 15 years ago, our son was coming back from college in New York.
Now, we're big shots in PFLAG, and we just talk about it to them, try and make them feel more comfortable with it.
And I didn't have a clue that he was gay, not a clue.
I'm a trained facilitator, so I can lead support groups.
I'm kind of the poster child, I think, for somebody who had a really bad reaction to it.
And I'd like to take back everything I said to him the night he came out, but it doesn't go away, and unfortunately, I speak a lot, so I have to remember it.
Their involvement in PFLAG has been amazing.
I think at some point Mom said that it's the parents' role to fight for change, and it's the kids' role to have as normal a life as possible and just get on with things.
You just always think you know what's best, and you're wrong.
Yeah, parents, are only smart for a very small window of time.
I'm happy with who I am because of them.
Yeah.
I'm not very good at finishing my sentences.
I've spent the last 20 years helping other people understand and accept the gender variations in their children, and there are a lot of gender variations.
And they're all okay, and I hope you put that in this movie.
Mom!
Now I wanna find my husband so that we get a group picture.
-Okay. Yeah. -You guys will be at the end.
We're taking a picture? You're here to take a picture?Good.
Dad, give me the camera. You should go in.
Okay, I'll get one.
Okay.
You organized a really big picture. That was hard.
I know, and don't keep calling me, because this is like my job at PFLAG to do this.
I'm not. That was it.
Hi again!
Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, PFLAG!
Forty years, ladies and gentlemen,Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, moms, dads, brothers, sisters, proud parents.
If you watch the parade, you'll see nobody gets this kind of cheering.
Just the PFLAG, and it's for the parents who came before us, the people who were there when there was nobody standing up for the people who came out as gay.
I wish my parents were here.
-Dad, look, there's your store. - I know!
Barry!
No one has ever given us anything we haven't had to fight for.
I have seen so many changes in this world.
For the better and for the worse.
But I have hope, and there is hope.
I'm not gonna end this on a sour note.
This is a good note, because people are more together today than they ever have been.
It's our last hour, so shop quick.
-Last hour？ - Yep.
We're gonna put up the closed sign pretty soon.
You can be the last customer maybe.
Okay.
Owner of the last item sold by Circus of Books.
Yeah.
I always like to be anonymous, but you could sign it "anonymous" if you really wanna be a purist.
No, at this point, I'm pretty public about it.
All right!
Barry and Karen have always been like Mom and Dad almost.
We've always had our surrogate. Like family here. - Yeah.
-Goodbye, Karen. -You're great.
Thank you. I'll miss you.
You're gonna go on to do good things. I know you are.
-It was great working with you. -Thank you, Barry.
-And I hope everything goes well. - Thank you.
- I need to give you a hug. - Oh, Karen!
-Thank you so much for everything. -You've been wonderful.
It's not an easy trick to be married and be in business together for such a long time.
-Very hard, actually. - Yeah, he had to listen to me a lot.
Mr. Baldwin, I'm sure you still meet the remark that:
"What are the Negroes... why aren't they optimistic?” They say, "But it's getting so much better.
There are negro mayors, there are negroes in all of sports."
There are negroes in politics.
They're even accorded the ultimate accolade of being in television commercials now.
I'm glad you're smiling.
Is it at once getting much better and still hopeless?
I don't think there's much hope for it, you know, to tell you the truth, as long as people are using this peculiar language.
It's not a question of what happens to the Negro here, or to the black man here, that's a very vivid question for me, you know, but the real question is what's going to happen to this country.
I have to repeat that.
The summer has scarcely begun, and I feel already that it's almost over.
And I will be 55.
Yes, 55, in a month.
I am about to undertake the journey.
And this is a journey to tell you the truth, which I always knew that I would have to make, but had hoped, perhaps, certainly had hoped, not to have to make so soon.
I am saying that a journey is called that because you cannot know what you will discover on the journey, what you will do with what you find, or what you find will do to you.
Not only have a right to be free,
- we have a duty to be free. - Yeah.
And so when you sit down on the bus and you sit down in the front, or sit down by a white person, you are sitting there because you have a duty to sit down, not merely because you have a right.
The time of these lives and deaths, from a public point of view, is 1955, when we first heard of Martin, to 1968, when he was murdered.
Medgar was murdered in the summer of 1963.
Malcolm was murdered in 1965.
The three men, Medgar, Malcolm, and Martin, were very different men.
Consider that Martin was only 26 in 1955.
He took on his shoulders the weight of the crimes, and the lies, and the hope of a nation.
I want these three lives to bang against and reveal each other, as in truth, they did.
And use their dreadful journey as a means of instructing the people whom they loved so much, who betrayed them, and for whom they gave their lives.
The moment a negro child walks into the school, every decent, self-respecting, loving parent should take his white child out of that broken school.
Go back to your own school.
God forgives murder and he forgives adultery.
But He is very angry and He actually curses all who do integrate.
That's when I saw the photograph.
On every newspaper kiosk on that wide, tree-shaped boulevard in Paris, were photographs of 15-year-old Dorothy Counts being reviled and spat upon by the mob as she was making her way to school in Charlotte, North Carolina.
There was unutterable pride, tension and anguish in that girl's face as she approached the halls of learning, with history jeering at her back.
It made me furious, it filled me with both hatred and pity.
And it made me ashamed.
Some one of us should have been there with her!
But it was on that bright afternoon that I knew I was leaving France.
I could simply no longer sit around Paris, discussing the Algerian and the Black American problem.
Everybody else was paying their dues, and it was time I went home and paid mine.
I had at last come home.
If there was, in this, some illusion, there was also much truth.
In the years in Paris, I had never been homesick for anything American.
Neither waffles, ice cream, hot dogs, baseball, majorettes, movies, nor the Empire State Building, nor Coney Island, nor the Statue of Liberty, nor the Daily News, nor Times Square.
All of these things had passed out of me.
They might never have existed, and it made absolutely no difference to me if I never saw them again.
But I missed my brothers and sisters, and my mother.
They made a difference.
I wanted to be able to see them, and to see their children.
I hoped that they wouldn't forget me.
I missed Harlem Sunday mornings and fried chicken, and biscuits, I missed the music, I missed the style... that style possessed by no other people in the world.
I missed the way the dark face closes, the way dark eyes watch, and the way when a dark face opens, a light seems to go everywhere.
I missed, in short, my connections, missed the life which had produced me and nourished me and paid for me.
Now, though I was a stranger, I was home.
I am fascinated by the movement on and off the screen.
I am about seven.
I'm with my mother, or my aunt.
The movie is Dance, Fools, Dance.
I was aware that Joan Crawford was a white lady.
Yet, I remember being sent to the store sometime later, and a colored woman who, to me, looked exactly like Joan Crawford, was buying something.
She was incredibly beautiful.
She looked down at me with so beautiful a smile that I was not even embarrassed, which was rare for me.
By this time, I had been taken in hand by a young white schoolteacher named Bill Miller, a beautiful woman, very important to me.
She gave me books to read and talked to me about the books, and about the world, about Ethiopia, and Italy, and the German Third Reich, and took me to see plays and films, to which no one else would have dreamed of taking a ten-year-old boy.
It is certainly because of Bill Miller, who arrived in my terrifying life so soon, that I never really managed to hate white people.
Though, God knows, I've often wished to murder more than one or two.
Therefore, I begin to suspect that white people did not act as they did because they were white, but for some other reason.
I was a child of course, and therefore unsophisticated.
I took Bill Miller as she was, or as she appeared to be to me.
She too, anyway, was treated like a nigger, especially by the cops, and she had no love for landlords.
In these days, no one resembling my father has yet made an appearance on the American cinema scene.
No, it's not entirely true.
There were, for example, Stepin Fetchit and Willie Best and Mantan Moreland, all of whom, rightly or wrongly, I loathed.
It seemed to me that they lied about the world I knew, and debased it, and certainly I did not know anybody like them, as far as I could tell.
For it is also possible that their comic, bug-eyed terror contained the truth concerning a terror by which I hoped never to be engulfed.
Yet, I had no reservations at all concerning the terror of the Black janitor in "They won't Forget".
Give me police!
Give me police!
Give me -- Give me police!
I think that it was a black actor named Clinton Rosemond who played this part, and he looked a little like my father.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it!
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!
He is terrified because a young white girl in this small Southern town has been raped and murdered, and her body has been found upon the premises of which he is the janitor.
Good morning, Tom.
The role of the janitor is small, yet the man's face bangs in my memory until today.
- I have done nothing. - Nobody says you have, Tom.
But they might.
The film's icy brutality both scared me What for?
and strengthened me.
Because Uncle Tom refuses to take vengeance in his own hands, he was not a hero for me.
Heroes, as far as I could see, were white, and not merely because of the movies, but because of the land in which I lived, of which movies were simply a reflection.
I despised and feared those heroes because they did take vengeance into their own hands.
They thought vengeance was theirs to take.
And, yes, I understood that my countrymen were my enemy.
I suspect that all these stories are designed to reassure us that no crime was committed.
We've made a legend out of a massacre.
Leaving aside all the physical facts which one can quote.
Leaving aside rape or murder.
Leaving aside the bloody catalog of oppression, which we are, in one way, too familiar with already, what this does to the subjugated is to destroy his sense of reality.
This means, in the case of an American negro, born in that glittering republic, and in the moment you are born, since you don't know any better, every stick and stone and every face is white, and since you have not yet seen a mirror, you suppose that you are too.
It comes as a great shock around the age of five, or six, or seven, to discover that Gary Cooper killing off the Indians, when you were rooting for Gary Cooper, that the Indians were you.
It comes as a great shock to discover the country, which is your birthplace, and to which you owe your life and your identity, has not, in its whole system of reality, evolved any place for you.
I know how to do it, technically.
It is a matter of research and journeys.
And with you or without you, I will do it anyway.
I begin in September, when I go on the road.
"The road" means my return to the South.
It means briefly, for example, seeing Myrlie Evers, and the children.
Those children who are children no longer.
It means going back to Atlanta, to Selma, to Birmingham.
It means seeing Coretta Scott King, and Martin's children.
I know that Martin's daughter, whose name I don't remember, and Malcolm's oldest daughter, whose name is Attalah are both in the theatre, and apparently are friends.
It means seeing Betty Shabazz, Malcolm's widow, and the five younger children.
It means exposing myself as one of the witnesses to the lives and deaths of their famous fathers.
And it means much, much more than that.
"A cloud of witnesses," as old St. Paul once put it.
I saw Malcolm before I met him.
I was giving a lecture somewhere in New York.
Malcolm was sitting in the first row of the hall, bending forward at such an angle that his long arms nearly caressed the ankles of his long legs, staring up at me.
I very nearly panicked.
I knew Malcolm only by legend, and this legend, since I was a Harlem street boy, I was sufficiently astute to distrust.
Malcolm might be the torch that white people claim he was, though, in general, white America's evaluations of these matters would be laughable and even pathetic did not these evaluations have such wicked results.
On the other hand, Malcolm had no reason to trust me either.
And so I stumbled through my lecture, with Malcolm never taking his eyes from my face.
As a member of the NAACP, Medgar was investigating the murder of a black man, which had occurred months before, had shown me letters from black people asking him to do this, and he had asked me to come with him.
I was terribly frightened, but perhaps that fieldtrip will help us define what I mean by the word "Witness".
I was to discover that the line which separates a witness from an actor is a very thin line indeed.
Nevertheless, the line is real.
I was not, for example, a Black Muslim, in the same way, though for different reasons, that I never became a Black Panther.
Because I did not believe that all white people were devils, and I did not want young black people to believe that.
I was not a member of any Christian congregation because I knew that they had not heard and did not live by the commandment, "Love one another as I love you."
And I was not a member of the NAACP because in the North, where I grew up, the NAACP was fatally entangled with black class distinctions, or illusions of the same, which repelled a shoe-shine boy like me.
I did not have to deal with the criminal state of Mississippi, hour by hour and day by day, to say nothing of night after night.
I did not have to sweat cold sweat after decisions involving hundreds of thousands of lives.
I was not responsible for raising money, or deciding how to use it.
I was not responsible for strategy controlling prayer-meetings, marches, petitions, voting registration drives.
I saw the Sheriffs, the Deputies, the Storm Troopers, more or less in passing.
I was never in town to stay.
This was sometimes hard on my morale, but I had to accept, as time were on, that part of my responsibility, as a witness, was to move as largely and as freely as possible.
To write the story, and to get it out.
We should all be concerned with but one goal, the eradication of crime.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is as close to you as your nearest telephone.
It seeks to be your protector in all matters within its jurisdiction.
It belongs to you.
White people are astounded by Birmingham.
Black people aren't.
White people are endlessly demanding to be reassured that Birmingham is really on Mars.
They don't want to believe, still less to act on the belief, that what is happening in Birmingham is happening all over the country.
They don't want to realize that there is not one step, morally or actually, between Birmingham and Los Angeles.
Move on, move on!
We've invited three men, on the forefront of The Negro Struggle, to sit down and talk with us in front of the television camera.
Each of these men, through his actions and his words, but with vastly different manner and means, is a spokesman for some segment of the Negro people today.
Black people in this country have been the victims of violence at the hands of the white man for 400 years.
And following the ignorant negro preachers, we have thought that it was Godlike to turn the other cheek to the brute that was brutalizing us.
Malcolm X, one of the most articulate exponents of the Black Muslim philosophy, has said of your movement and your philosophy that it plays into the hands of the white oppressors, that they are happy to hear you talk about love for the oppressor, because this disarms the Negro and fits into the stereotype of the Negro as a meek, turning the other cheek sort of creature.
Would you care to comment on Mr. X's beliefs?
Well, I don't think of love as in this context, as emotional bosh, but I think of love as something strong and that organizes itself into powerful direct action.
This is what I've tried to teach in the struggle in the South.
We are not engaged in a struggle that means we sit down and do nothing.
There is a great deal of difference between non-resistance to evil and non-violent resistance.
Martin Luther King is just a 20th century or modern Uncle Tom or a religious Uncle Tom, who is doing the same thing today to keep Negroes defenseless in the face of attack that Uncle Tom did on the plantation to keep those Negroes defenseless in the face of the attacks of the Klan in that day.
I think, though, that we can be sure that the vast majority of Negroes who engage in the demonstrations, and who understand the non-violent philosophy, will be able to face dogs and all of the other brutal methods that are used without retaliating with violence, because they understand that one of the first principles of non-violence is a willingness to be the recipient of violence, while never inflicting violence upon another.
As concerns Malcolm and Martin, I watched two men, coming from unimaginably different backgrounds, whose positions, originally, were poles apart, driven closer and closer together.
By the time each died, their positions had become, virtually, the same position.
It can be said, indeed, that Martin picked up Malcolm's burden, articulated the vision which Malcolm had begun to see, and for which he paid with his life, and that Malcolm was one of the people Martin saw on the mountain-top.
Medgar was too young to have seen this happen, though he hoped for it, and would not have been surprised.
But Medgar was murdered first.
I was older than Medgar, Malcolm and Martin.
I was raised to believe that the eldest was supposed to be a model for the younger, and was, of course, expected to die first.
Not one of these three lived to be forty.
Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to integrate!
Two, four, six, eight, we don't want to integrate!
We want King! We want King! We want King!
We need an organization that no one downtown loves.
We need one that's ready and willing to take action, any kind of action, by any means necessary.
When Malcolm talks, or one of the Muslim ministers talk, they articulate for all the Negro people who hear them, who listen to them, they articulate their suffering.
The suffering which has been in this country so long denied.
That's Malcolm's great authority over any of his audiences.
He corroborates their reality.
He tells them that they really exist, you know.
Get back. Get back!
- I am! - Michael Brown!
- I am! - Michael Brown!
There are days, this is one of them when you wonder, what your role is in this country and what your future is in it.
How precisely are you going to reconcile, yourself to your situation here, and how you are going to communicate to the vast, heedless, unthinking cruel white majority that you are here.
I'm terrified at the moral apathy, the death of the heart, which is happening in my country.
These people have deluded themselves for so long that they really don't think I'm human.
I base this on their conduct, not on what they say.
And this means that they have become, in themselves moral monsters.
Most of the white Americans I've ever encountered, really, you know, had a Negro friend or a Negro maid or somebody in high school, but they never, you know, or rarely, after school was over or whatever, came to my kitchen, you know.
We were segregated from the schoolhouse door.
Therefore, he doesn't know, he really does not know, what it was like for me to leave my house, to leave the school and go back to Harlem.
He doesn't know how Negroes live.
And it comes as a great surprise to the Kennedy brothers and to everybody else in the country.
I'm certain, again, you know, that again like most white Americans I have encountered, they have no, I'm sure they have nothing whatever against Negroes.
That's really not the question.
The question is really a kind of apathy and ignorance, which is the price we pay for segregation.
That's what segregation means.
You don't know what's happening on the other side of the wall, because you don't want to know.
I was in some way, in those years, without entirely realizing it, the Great Black Hope of the Great White Father.
I was not a racist, or so I thought.
Malcolm was a racist, or so they thought.
In fact, we were simply trapped in the same situation.
Well, you tell that to my boy tonight, when you put him to sleep on the living room couch.
And you tell it to him in the morning, when his mother goes out of here to take care of somebody else's kids.
And tell it to me, when we want some curtains or some drapes and you sneak out of here and go work in somebody's kitchen.
All I want is to make a future for this family.
All I want is to be able to stand in front of my boy like my father never was able to do to me.
Lorraine Hansberry would not be very much younger than I am now, if she were alive.
At the time of the Bobby Kennedy meeting, she was thirty-three.
That was one of the very last times I saw her on her feet, and she died at the age of thirty-four.
I miss her so much.
People forget how young everybody was.
Bobby Kennedy, for another, quite different example, was thirty-eight.
We wanted him to tell his brother, the president, to personally escort to school, on that day or the day after, a small black girl, already scheduled to enter Deep South School.
"That way," We said, "It will be clear that whoever spits on that child will be spitting on the nation."
He didn't understand this either.
"It would be," he said, "a meaningless moral gesture."
"We would like," said Lorraine, "from you, a moral commitment".
He looked insulted, seemed to feel that he'd been wasting his time.
Well, Lorraine sat still, watching all the while.
She looked at Bobby Kennedy, who, perhaps for the first time, looked at her.
"But I am very worried," she said, "about the state of the civilization which produced that photograph of the white cop standing on that Negro woman's neck in Birmingham."
Then she smiled.
And I am glad that she was not smiling at me.
"Goodbye Mr. Attorney General," she said, and turned and walked out of the room.
And then, we heard the thunder.
He stopped at his house on the way to the airport so I could autograph my books for him, his wife and children.
I remember Myrlie Evers standing outside, smiling, and we waved, and Medgar drove to the airport and put me on the plane.
Months later, I was in Puerto Rico, working on my play.
Lucien and I had spent a day or so wandering around the island, and now we were driving home.
It was a wonderful, bright, sunny day, the top to the car was down, we were laughing and talking, and the radio was playing.
Then the music stopped and a voice announced that Medgar Evers had been shot to death in the carport of his home, and his wife and children had seen the big man fall.
The blue sky seemed to descend like a blanket.
And I couldn't say anything, I couldn't cry.
I just remembered his face, a bright, blunt, handsome face, and his weariness, which he wore like his skin, and the way he said "ro-aad" for road.
And his telling me how the tatters of clothes from a lynched body hung, flapping in the tree for days, and how he had to pass that tree every day.
Medgar.
Gone.
In America, I was free only in battle, never free to rest, and he who finds no way to rest cannot long survive the battle.
And the young, white revolutionary remains, in general, far more romantic than a black one.
White people have managed to get through entire lifetimes in this euphoric state, but black people have not been so lucky.
A black man who sees the world the way John Wayne, for example, sees it would not be an eccentric patriot, but a raving maniac.
The truth is that this country does not know what to do with its black population, dreaming of anything like "The Final Solution".
The Negro has never been as docile as white Americans wanted to believe.
That was a myth.
We were not singing and dancing down the levee.
We were trying to keep alive, we were trying to survive a very brutal system.
The nigger has never been happy in his place.
One of the most terrible things, is that, whether I like it or not, I am an American.
My school really was the streets of New York City.
My frame of reference was George Washington and John Wayne.
But I was a child, you know, and when a child puts his eyes on the world, he has to use what he sees.
There's nothing else to use.
And you are formed by what you see, the choices you have to make, and the way you discover what it means to be black in New York and then throughout the entire country.
I know how you watch, as you grow older, and it's not a figure of speech, the corpses of your brothers and your sisters pile up around you.
And not for anything they have done.
They were too young to have done anything.
But what one does realize is that when you try to stand up and look the world in the face like you had a right to be here, you have attacked the entire power structure of the western world.
Forget "The Negro Problem".
Don't write any voting acts.
We had that. It's called The Fifteenth Amendment.
During the Civil Rights Bill of 1964, what you have to look at is what is happening in this country, and what is really happening is that brother has murdered brother, knowing it was his brother.
White men have lynched Negroes, knowing them to be their sons.
White women have had Negroes burned, knowing them to be their lovers.
It is not a racial problem.
It's a problem of whether or not you're willing to look at your life and be responsible for it, and then begin to change it.
That great western house I come from is one house, and I am one of the children of that house.
Simply, I am the most despised child of that house.
And it is because the American people are unable to face the fact that I am flesh of their flesh, bone of their bone, created by them.
My blood, my father's blood, is in that soil.
Good afternoon, Ma'am.
It's raining so hard, I brought rubbers and coat to fetch my little girl home.
I'm afraid you've made some mistake.
Ain't this the 3B?
- Yes. - Well, this is it.
It can't be it.
I have no little colored children in my class.
Oh, thank you.
There's my little girl.
Peola, you may you home.
Gee, I didn't know she was colored.
Neither did I.
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you!
Peola! Peola!
I know very well that my ancestors had no desire to come to this place.
But neither did the ancestors of the people who became white, and who require of my captivity a song.
They require a song of me, less to celebrate my captivity than to justify their own.
I have always been struck, in America, by an emotional poverty so bottomless, and a terror of human life, of human touch, so deep that virtually no American appears able to achieve any viable, organic connection between his public stance and his private life.
This failure of the private life has always had the most devastating effect on American public conduct, and on black-white relations.
If Americans were not so terrified of their private selves, they would never have become so dependent on what they call "The Negro Problem".
They said it wasn't nice to say "Nigger".
Nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!
Poor little nigger kids, love the little nigger kids.
Who loved me?
Who loved me?
This problem, which they invented in order to safeguard their purity, has made of them criminals and monsters, and it is destroying them.
And this, not from anything Blacks may or may not be doing, but because of the role of a guilty and constricted white imagination has assigned to the Blacks.
Look man, don't give me that look.
You should have got what was coming to you after spitting in that guy's face.
Why you... It is impossible to accept the premise of the story, a premise based on the profound American misunderstanding of the nature of the hatred between black and white.
That time is now.
The root of the black man's hatred is rage, and he does not so much hate white men as simply wants them out of his way, and more than that, out of his children's way.
The root of the white man's hatred is terror.
I'm gonna kill you.
A bottomless and nameless terror, which focuses on this dread figure, an entity which lives only in his mind.
Run!
Come on!
I can't make it, I can't make it!
When Sidney jumps off the train, the white liberal people downtown were much relieved and joyful.
But when black people saw him jump off the train, they yelled, "Get back on the train, you fool!"
The black man jumps off the train in order to reassure white people, to make them know that they are not hated, that though they have made human errors, they done nothing for which to be hated.
I'm Chiquita Banana, and I'm here to say I am the top banana.
In spite of the fabulous myths proliferating in this country concerning the sexuality of black people, black men are still used, in the popular culture, as though they had no sexual equipment at all.
Sidney Poitier, as a black artist, and a man, is also up against the infantile, furtive sexuality of this country.
Both he and Harry Belafonte, for example, are sex symbols, though no one dares admit that, still less to use them as any of the Hollywood he-men are used.
Black people have been robbed of everything in this country.
I've got something to say to you, boy.
and they don't want to be robbed of their artist.
Black people particularly disliked guess Who's Coming to Dinner, because they felt that Sidney was, in effect, being used against them.
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner may prove, in some bizarre way, to be a milestone, because it is really quite impossible to go any further in that particular direction.
The next time, the kissing will have to start.
Well, you've got your ticket?
Here you are.
Thank you.
I am aware that men do not kiss each other in American films, nor, for the most part, in America.
Nor do the black detective and the white Sheriff kiss here.
You take care, you hear?
Yeah.
But the obligatory, fade-out-kiss in the classic American film, did not speak of love, and still less of sex.
It spoke of reconciliation, of all things now becoming possible.
I knew a blond girl in the village a long time ago, and eventually, we never walked out of the house together.
She was far safer walking the streets alone than when walking with me, a brutal and humiliating fact which thoroughly destroyed whatever relationship this girl and I might have been able to achieve.
This happens all the time in America, but Americans have yet to realize what a sinister fact this is, and what it says about them.
When we walked out in the evening, then, she would leave ahead of me, alone.
I would give about five minutes, and then I would walk out alone, taking another route, and meet her on the subway platform.
We would not acknowledge each other.
We would get into the subway car, sitting at opposite ends of it, and walk, separately, through the streets of the free and the brave, to wherever we were going a friend's house, or the movies.
All over the country, families such as this are enjoying new prosperity.
They have new interests, new standards of living, a buying power they've never enjoyed before.
They are good prospects for practically all types of goods and services.
All too often though, they are overlooked prospects.
Since 1940, in San Francisco alone, the Negro market has increased by 89%.
Here are millions of customers for what you have to sell.
Customers with 15 billion dollars to spend.
Someone once said to me that the people in general cannot bear very much reality.
He meant by this that they prefer fantasy to a truthful recreation of their experience.
People have quite enough reality to bear, by simply getting through their lives, raising their children, dealing with the eternal conundrums of birth, taxes, and death.
Negroes are continuously making progress here in this country.
The progress in many areas is not as fast as it should be, but they are making progress, and we will continue to make progress.
There's no reason that they, in a near and foreseeable future, that a Negro could also be president of the United States.
I remember, for example, when the ex-Attorney General, Mr.Robert Kennedy, said that it was conceivable that in 40 years in America, we might have a Negro president.
And that sounded like a very emancipated statement, I suppose, to white people.
They were not in Harlem when this statement was first heard.
And did not hear, and possibly will never hear, the laughter and the bitterness and the scorn with which this statement was greeted.
From the point of view of the man in the Harlem barbershop, Bobby Kennedy only got here yesterday.
And now he's already on his way to the Presidency.
We've been here for 400 years and now he tells us that maybe in 40 years, if you're good, we may let you become president.
Let me put it this way, that from a very literal point of view, the harbors and the ports and the railroads of the country, the economy, especially in the southern states, could not conceivably be what it has become if they had not had, and do not still have, indeed, and for so long, so many generations, cheap labor.
It is a terrible thing for an entire people to surrender to the notion that one ninth of its population is beneath them.
And until that moment, until the moment comes, when we, the Americans, we, the American people, are able to accept the fact that I have to accept, for example, that my ancestors are both white and black.
That on that continent we are trying to forge a new identity for which we need each other, and that I am not a ward of America.
I am not an object of missionary charity, I am one of the people who built the country.
Until this moment, there is scarcely any hope for the American Dream, because people who are denied participation in it, by their very presence will wreck it.
And if that happens, it is a very grave moment for the West.
Thank you.
We 're here in the studio today with seven men who have two things in common:
they are entertainers and artists; and they've all come to Washington.
They are seven out of some two hundred thousand American citizens who came to the capital to march for freedom and for jobs.
Will this tremendous outburst now lead to a course of action, Mr. Belafonte?
The now that is being spoken about is the fact that in a hundred years, finally, through whatever the causes have been in history, and most of them have been because of oppression, the Negro people have strongly and fully taken the bit in their teeth, they're asking absolutely no quarter from anyone.
But I do say that the bulk of the interpretation of whether this thing is going to end successfully and joyously, or is going to end disastrously, lays very heavily with the white community, it lays very heavily with the profiteers, it lays very heavily with the vested interests.
It lays very heavily with a great middle stream in this country, of people who have refused to commit themselves, or even have the slightest knowledge that these things have been going on.
I am speaking as a member of a certain democracy in a very complex country, which insists on being very narrow-minded.
Simplicity is taken to be a great American virtue, along with sincerity.
I am sorry.
I am deeply sorry.
And I am sorry.
I'm deeply sorry about that.
They are no excuses.
I am solely.
We have made plenty of mistakes.
For that, I apologize.
I am very sorry.
I'm sorry I did this to you, but you gotta get used to it.
It's one of those little problems in life.
I take full responsibility.
I'm here today to again apologize.
I'll just apologize for that to her.
For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility.
It's an honor to serve the city of Ferguson and the people who live there.
One of the results of this is that immaturity is taken to be a virtue too.
So that someone like that, let's say John Wayne, who spent most of his time on screen admonishing Indians, was in no necessity to grow up.
I had been in London on this particular night.
We were free and we decided to treat ourselves to a really fancy, friendly dinner.
The head waiter came and said there was a phone call for me, and my sister Gloria rose to take it.
She was very strange when she came back.
She didn't say anything, and I began to be afraid to ask her anything.
Then, nibbling at something she obviously wasn't tasting, she said, "Well, I've got to tell you because the press is on its way over here.
They have just killed Malcolm."
There is nothing in the evidence offered by the book of The American Republic, which allows me really to argue with the cat who says to me, "They needed us to pick the cotton, and now they don't need us anymore.
Now they don't need us, they're gonna kill us all off, just like they did the Indians"
And I can't say it's a Christian nation.
Though your brothers will never do that to you, because the record is too long and too bloody.
That's all we have done.
All your buried corpses now begin to speak.
I say violence is necessary.
Violence is a part of America's culture.
It is as American as cherry pie.
Black power, Brothers.
If we were white, if we were Irish, if we were Jewish, if we were Poles, if we had, in fact, in your mind, a frame of reference, our heroes would be your heroes too.
Nat Turner would be a hero for you instead of a threat.
Malcolm X might still be alive.
Everyone is very proud of brave little Israel, a state against which I have nothing, I don't want to be misinterpreted, I'm not an anti-Semite.
But, you know, when the Israelis pick up guns, or the Poles, or the Irish, or any white man in the world says, "Give me liberty, or give me death", the entire white world applauds.
When a black man says exactly the same thing, word for word, he is judged a criminal and treated like one and everything possible is done to make an example of this bad nigger, so there won't be any more like him.
Look out across this land we love, look about you whatever you are, this unending scenic beauty, and there's freedom, it's an inherent American right meaning many different things to every single citizen.
It's a leisurely afternoon of golf along a pleasant course.
It's an amusement park, a rollercoaster ride.
A day at the county fair.
A day of excitement, unrestricted travel across all our 50 states, unlimited enjoyment of all these jewels in the continent's crown.
For all of us, there's all of America, in all of its scenic beauty, all of its heritage of history, all of its limitless opportunity.
We've dropped too many bombs on Vietnam now.
Let us save our national honor!
Stop the bombing, and stop the war!
What I am trying to say to this country, to us, is that we must know this.
We must realize this, that no other country in the world have been so fat and so sleek, and so safe, and so happy, and so irresponsible, and so dead.
No other country can afford to dream of a Plymouth and a wife and a house with a fence, and the children growing up safely to go to college and to become executives, and then to marry, and have the Plymouth and the house and so forth.
A great many people do not live this way, and cannot imagine it, and do not know that when we talk about "Democracy", this is what we mean.
The industry is compelled, given the way it is built, to present to the American people a self-perpetuating fantasy of American life.
Their concept of entertainment is difficult to distinguish from the use of narcotics.
What worries you about them having black partners?
Do you think people are gonna look down on them, or judge them?
Yes, I think people look down.
To watch the TV screen for any length of time is to learn some really frightening things about the American sense of reality.
We are cruelly trapped between what we would like to be and what we actually are.
And we cannot possibly become what we would like to be until we are willing to ask ourselves just why the lives we lead on this continent are mainly so empty, so tame, and so ugly.
These images are designed not to trouble, but to reassure.
They also weaken our ability to deal with the world as it is, ourselves as we are.
I would like to add someone to our group here, Professor Paul Weiss, the sterling professor of philosophy at Yale.
Were you able to listen to the show backstage?
I heard a good deal of it, but then I was behind the whatsitmajig.
-Yes. -So I heard only some of it.
Did you hear anything that you disagreed with?
I disagreed with a great deal of it, and of course, there's a good deal I agree with.
But I think he's overlooking one very important matter, I think.
Each one of us, I think, is terribly alone.
He lives his own individual life.
He has all kind of obstacles, the way of religion or color or size or shape or lack of ability, and the problem is to become a man.
But what I was discussing was not that problem, really.
I was discussing the difficulties, the obstacles, the very real danger of death thrown up by the society when a Negro, when a black man, attempts to become a man.
All this emphasis upon black man and white, does emphasize something which is here, but it emphasizes, or perhaps exaggerates it, and therefore makes us put people together in groups which they ought not to be in.
I have more in common with a black scholar than I have with a white man who is against scholarship.
And you have more in common with a white author than you have with someone who is against all literature.
So why must we always concentrate on color, or religion, or this?
There are other ways of connecting men.
I'll tell you this.
When I left this country in 1948, I left this country for one reason only, one reason I didn't care where I went.
I might've gone to Hong Kong, I might have gone to Timbuktu.
I ended up in Paris, on the streets of Paris, with 40 dollars in my pocket and the theory that nothing worse could happen to me there than had already happened to me here.
You talk about making it as a writer by yourself, you have to be able then to turn up all the antennae by which you live, because once you turn your back on this society, you may die.
You may die.
And it's very hard to sit at a typewriter, and concentrate on that, if you are afraid of the world around you.
The years I lived in Paris did one thing for me:
they released me from that particular social terror, which was not the paranoia of my own mind, but a real social danger visible in the face of every cop, every boss, everybody.
I don't know what most white people in this country feel.
But I can only include what they feel from that state of their institutions.
I don't know if white Christians hate Negroes or not, but I know we have a Christian church which is white and a Christian church which is black.
I know, as Malcolm X once put it, the most segregated hour in American life is high noon on Sunday.
That says a great deal for me about a Christian nation.
It means I can't afford to trust most white Christians and I certainly cannot trust the Christian church.
I don't know whether the labor unions and their bosses really hate me. That doesn't matter, but I know I'm not in their unions.
I don't know if the Real Estate Lobby has anything against black people, but I know the Real Estate Lobby is keeping me in the ghetto.
I don't know if the board of education hates black people, but I know the textbooks they give my children to read, and the schools that we have to go to.
Now, this is the evidence.
You want me to make an act of faith, risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children, on some idealism which you assure me exists in America, which I have never seen.
Hold on a second.
All of the Western nations have been caught in a lie, the lie of their pretended humanism.
This means that their history has no moral justification, and that the West has no moral authority.
"Vile as I am,"
states one of the characters in Dostoevsky's The Idiot, "I don't believe in the wagons that bring bread to humanity.
For the wagons that bring bread to humanity, may coldly exclude a considerable part of humanity from enjoying what is brought."
For a very long time, America prospered.
This prosperity cost millions of people their lives.
Now, not even the people who are the most spectacular recipients of the benefits of this prosperity are able to endure these benefits.
They can neither understand them nor do without them.
Above all, they cannot imagine the price paid by their victims, or subjects, for this way of life, and so they cannot afford to know why the victims are revolting.
Down!
- On the ground! - Get on the ground, now!
Damn, man!
This is the formula for a nation or a kingdom decline.
For no kingdom can maintain itself by force alone.
Force does not work the way its advocates think in fact it does.
It does not, for example, reveal to the victim the strength of the adversary.
On the contrary, it reveals the weakness, even the panic of the adversary.
And this revelation invests the victim with passion.
There is a day in Palm Springs that I will remember forever, a bright day.
I was based in Hollywood, working on the screen version of the autobiography of Malcolm X.
This was a difficult assignment, since I had known Malcolm, after all, crossed swords with him, worked with him, and held him in that great esteem which is not easily distinguishable, if it is distinguishable, from love.
Billy Dee Williams had come to town and he was staying at the house.
I very much wanted Billy Dee for the role of Malcolm.
The phone had been brought out to the pool, and now it rang.
And I picked up.
The record player was still playing.
"He's not dead yet, but it's a head wound."
I have some very sad news for all of you, and I think sad news for all our fellow citizens and people who love peace all over the world.
And that is that Martin Luther King was shot and was killed tonight.
I hardly remember the rest of the evening at all.
I remember weeping, briefly, more in helpless rage than in sorrow, and Billy trying to comfort me.
But I really don't remember that evening at all.
And I was concentrating on holding myself together.
I did not want to weep for Martin.
Tears seemed futile.
But I may also have been afraid, and I could not have been the only one, that if I began to weep, I would not be able to stop.
I started to cry, and I stumbled.
Sammy grabbed my arm.
The story of the Negro in America is the story of America.
It is not a pretty story.
What can we do?
Well, I am tired.
I don't know how it will come about, I know that no matter how it comes about, it will be bloody, it will be hard.
I still believe that we can do with this country something that has not been done before.
We are misled here because we think of numbers.
You don't need numbers, you need passion.
And this is proven by the history of the world.
The tragedy is that most of the people who say they care about it do not care.
What they care about is their safety and their profits.
The American way of life has failed to make people happier, or make them better.
We do not want to admit this, and we do not admit it.
We persist in believing that the empty and criminal among our children are the result of some miscalculation in the formula that can be corrected.
That the bottomless and aimless hostility which makes our cities among the most dangerous in the world is created and felt by a handful of aberrants, that the lack, yawning everywhere in this country, of passionate conviction, of personal authority, proves only our rather appealing tendency to be gregarious and democratic.
To look around the United States today, is enough to make prophets and angels weep.
This is not the land of the free.
It is only very unwillingly and sporadically the home of the brave.
I sometimes feel it to be an absolute miracle that the entire black population of the United States of America has not long ago succumbed to raging paranoia.
People finally say to you, in an attempt to dismiss the social reality, "But you're so bitter!"
Well, I may or may not be bitter, but if I were, I would have good reasons for it.
Chief among them that American blindness, or cowardice, which allow us to pretend that life presents no reasons for being bitter.
In this country, for a dangerously long time, there have been two levels of experience.
One, to put it cruelly, can be summed up in the images of Gary Cooper and Doris Day, two of the most grotesque appeals to innocence the world has ever seen.
And the other, subterranean, indispensable, and denied, can be summed up, let us say, in the tone and in the face of Ray Charles.
There has never been any genuine confrontation between these two levels of experience.
You cannot lynch me and keep me in ghettos without becoming something monstrous yourselves.
And furthermore, you give me a terrifying advantage.
You never had to look at me.
I had to look at you.
I know more about you than you know about me.
Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.
History is not the past.
It is the present.
We carry our history with us.
We are our history.
If we pretend otherwise, we literally are criminals.
I attest to this.
The world is not white.
It never was white, cannot be white.
White is a metaphor for power, and that is simply a way of describing Chase Manhattan Bank.
I can't be a pessimist, because I'm alive.
To be a pessimist means you have agreed that human life is an academic matter, so I'm forced to be an optimist.
I am forced to believe that we can survive whatever we must survive.
But the Negro in this country, the future of the Negro in this country is precisely as bright or as dark as the future of the country.
It is entirely up to the American people and not representatives.
It is entirely up to the American people whether or not they are going to face and deal with and embrace the stranger they have maligned so long.
What white people have to do is try to find out, in their own hearts, why it was necessary to have a "Nigger" in the first place, because I'm not a nigger, I'm a man.
But if you think I'm a nigger, it means you need him.
The question you've got to ask yourself, the white population of this country has got to ask itself, North and South, because it's one country, and for the Negro, there is no difference between the North and the South, it's just a difference in the way they castrate you, but the fact of the castration is the American fact.
If I'm not the nigger here and you invented him, you the white people invented him, then you've got to find out why.
And the future of the country depends on that, whether or not it's able to ask that question.
Everyone get close to everyone so you can touch someone.
This is very serious. It's more serious than you can imagine.
Let's pray.
Father, we thank you for... just being our God, and for all that you do.
We thank you for this day, and... we thank you for the chill in this air, Father.
Because we thank you for the sunshine, because you create the chill and you create the sunshine.
And you know these are tough times, Father.
We're asking this morning for your guidance.
- Amen. - Amen.
We stand here today, uh, with a plant that's closing, with a... a deep, rich history, and, uh, it's sad for me and, I'm sure, everybody else in there to see it go, but I will say this:
I'm extremely proud of the people that work in this plant here.
There's none better.
They know how to get the job done.
- How old are these houses?  - Two hundred years?
No way! America was founded only 200 years ago.
-Then at least several decades.  - Yeah, maybe.
- Cold? - Yeah.
But this is really beautiful.
Yeah, gorgeous.
See, America's airspace is really busy.
There's one.
- And there.  - Mmm.
When you take a look at an automobile, you see glass all around it.
That's what we do.
We have about 70% of the market.
Okay? Which is pretty extensive.
We have facilities around the world, throughout China, United States now, with our plant here.
What we're doing is we're melding two cultures together:
the Chinese culture and the US culture.
So we are truly a global organization.
So, we do have three different shifts right now that we are working with.
A first, second, and a third. Pretty traditional.
You'll also have a 30-minute unpaid lunch.
Plus, there's two 15-minute paid breaks.
Plenty of opportunities, ladies and gentlemen.
Plenty of opportunities.
Is this a union shop?
We are not.
It is our desire to not be.
But we recognize that, one, we need to do things right by employees.
Okay? We recognize that.
- I have, actually, 28 years experience.  - Very good.
Payroll, human resources, operations, things like that.
I have a master's
- in mechanical engineering too, so...  - Okay, good. Super.
- Sounds like you got a lot of good skills.  - Well, I... Actually, I've worked
- in all kinds of different levels of...  - Yeah? Okay, good.
What we'll do is we'll take a look at your résumé. All right?
Where you sit today used to be a General Motors plant.
This plant closed, leaving 2,000 families unemployed.
And now, there are over 1,000 employees working here, with still more to be hired.
It was a little over two years ago that this facility was a very dark and very stark reminder of the greatest economic downturn in American history since the Great Depression.
And with that, you understand the... the personal impact that that has, individually and for the families of all those involved.
It's been a very fast process from the very beginning.
When I hired in, there was nothing in the plant.
And since that time, you can see, in the last six months, the amount of people and equipment that have come in.
And it's, uh, exciting.
The commitment everybody's put in, hard work.
Uh, we're looking forward to starting production.
Since you've arrived in America, I believe you've found many things different from life in China.
We need to get to know Americans.
America is a place to let your personality run free.
As long as you're not doing anything illegal, you're free to follow your heart.
You can even joke about the president.
Nobody will do anything to you.
Americans' cars are big and huge, very comfortable.
This represents the American sense of casualness.
They don't place a heavy importance on outfits and attire.
If you travel in Europe in the summertime, and you see someone walking in front of you, if he's wearing shorts, vests, and sports shoes, they must be an American.
Americans say what they are thinking directly.
They don't hide anything.
They are very obvious.
Everything is practical and realistic.
They dislike abstractions and theory in their daily lives.
Time is limited today, so I won't keep going.
The list here is really long.
Wow, thank you.
As required by Chairman, we will have an opening celebration on October 7th.
From now on, I ask you to keep October 7th in mind and work hard towards this grand celebration.
Welcome, Chairman. Good to see you.
This one is the Chevrolet S-10.
It was made in 1982.
That's the first one they made.
The first car from the GM plant.
Wow, Dayton was very well developed back then?
Exactly. A very well developed area.
"I have a secret to share, and from the bottom of my heart, I love Ohio, and I love the place where I invest significantly, here in Dayton."
This is a historic project that is gonna help grow this community, give people jobs, and give a future to your kids and my kids that did for those trucks back there when our parents and grandparents worked on refrigerators and cars.
And the future is bright, folks. The future is bright.
Please join me in acknowledging the newly-named Fuyao Avenue.
"Good morning, everyone. And we meet again today."
Every time I visit this plant, I see a lot of changes.
"Every time when I visit, I see great progress."
You see there's still empty space for more equipment.
It will all be installed within a year.
"If we can follow through with our plan and become successful here, this will be a great example of the US successfully attracting foreign investment."
Thank you very much.
"Thank you very much."
He says that a lot of people lost their jobs in this area, and he thanks you for the opportunity.
And tell him, one time, he has to come down here and eat some barbecue with us.
-Okay. -Thank you.
So the clients are satisfied?
Yes, very satisfied. Especially Chrysler.
I am pairing an American with a Chinese.
The American is the main operator, with a Chinese supervisor by their side.
They're pretty slow.
They have fat fingers.
We keep training them over and over.
How you doing?
The chairman has said from the beginning this is an American company.
It's Fuyao Glass America. It needs to be an American company, we need to treat it like an American company, but we need to be successful just like all our plants throughout the world.
So, basically, this line, that's the stage.
So from there back to the stage,
-and then people out that way. -Facing that way.
-Yeah. -We're talking, like, a concert stage without cover and potentially a overhang for weather.
We're gonna have to plan for that.
You know what I mean? Like, a concert... Chairman thinks we're okay with October weather, So you don't need any hang.
-No hang.  - What if it rains?
It won't.
It won't.
In October, the weather will be like it is today.
Chairman thinks, in October, the weather will be similar
- to... today.  -Today?
Also, Chairman says that door can't face this way.
-What door? -Face... You know, the opening right there.
Well, we just signed a contract, so...
-What? -That's a big... You gotta talk to Jimmy about... I don't know.
- I think it's...  - Jimmy, do you understand what he means?
We just did a purchase order and ordered a garage door and stuff.
So, you gotta face some other direction, I think.
They already put the door in.
So we're gonna have to change it. Is that okay?
-Yeah, we need to change it. -Okay.
Yeah, Z, just change it.
That's gonna cost us $35,000.
I have an idea, but I am not sure it's a good one.
We hang two artworks here.
One is something iconic of China, like the Great Wall.
- The other one is from the US.  - No. Only American ones.
Only American ones.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Don't upset them.
American, just... They haven't done good decorative work here.
This can't be here. It should be moved to the side.
There are... It's required by law to have one in here, and it has to be that height.
They're just saying
- that it should be moved to the side.  - We can move it, yeah.
Huh?
David says that is the required height.
We can't place it down there. It has to be that high.
We can move it to that corner.
Then up there.
It's a legal requirement. I'll ask him.
He has to ask and see. He knows this is the right height.
But sometimes, you have to think, uh, before you do, so then we don't have to redo the work, because it costs money.
Yeah, I've-- That was done... I wouldn't have necessarily moved, but that was done way before I got here.
Catch another big fish!
Did you all set the bait this way?
- Looks fucking cool! - How do you set it?
You got the Fuyao employees down here doing it.
-Oh, yeah?  - They all work at Fuyao.
-Fuyao or Fiyao?  - Fuyao.
Fiyao? Is that how it's pronounced?
Fuyao. F-U-Y-A-O.
-Fuyao, Inc.  - Fuyao?
-Yes, Fuyao Company.  - What type of company is that?
-Automotive glass. They make the glass...  -Yes, make glass.
-Oh, nice. Okay. -The car glass.
-Okay, wow, glass.  - Yes.
-Ooh, that's a big one right there. -Big, yes.
Very big.
-How speak English?  - Carp.
- Carp.  - Carp.
C-A-R-P. Carp.
- C-A-R-P. Carp. Carp. - Yep. Those are carp.
Now, the carp that you're catching likes corn and Wheaties.
Have you heard of Wheaties cereal?
- I don't know. Wheaty...  - Never heard of Wheaties?
-Wheaties? I don't know. -Wheaties.
-Wheaties. -Wheaties.
Yeah, buddy. You'd be surprised how good Wheaties works.
Wheaties? W-E-D-S?
W-E-E-T-E-S.
- No. I don't know that. - Okay. Yup, it does the best.
Looks like they're getting ready to go, huh?
We're going home to gut the fish, and we'll come back.
All right, Leon. I'mma go home and get me something to eat.
- I'll be back down.  - Okay, okay.
- I'll be back down. - Nice to meet you.
All right, Leon.
- Patty? - Yes?
-I'm getting ready to leave. -Okay.
-All right. -Have a good day.
For a year and a half, I didn't have anything.
When I started at Fuyao, I was thankful, I was blessed, I was... just on my knees, thanking God that I had something.
- Hey, what's up, man?  - Hey, what's going on?
Going good.
-All right? -Yeah.
This is the best game in town right now.
Going back in there for the first time, I kind of welled up because... I could see the post locations... you know, on the columns, you know?
Which actually tells you where you are in the plant.
People still get lost. I said, "I don't get lost."
At General Motors, I was making $29 and some change an hour.
At Fuyao, I make 12.84.
Back then, if my kids wanted a pair of new gym shoes, I could just go get them. I can't just do that now.
We lost our home, we lost a vehicle.
- Have a good weekend. -All right, you too.
When GM closed, I foreclosed on my house.
Ever since then, I have struggled to try to get back to middle class again.
I've been living in my sister's basement.
I am fortunate enough to have a bedroom.
And the only thing in here is my end tables and my TV.
The bed isn't mine. The bed is theirs.
You know? So, yeah.
We've been down about... I don't know, 45 minutes or so.
Water spots, I guess.
Thank you.
They've drained the washer. They're slowing it down.
They get upset when we're all trying to figure something out.
Everybody gets upset, and then everybody's upset in their own language, and then everybody just walks their own way, and... meet back here in five minutes.
Set the water temperature to 60°.
Because it has high alkalinity.
Okay. Later on, we're going to try to lower the... Okay.
Be careful!
Beautiful! Beautiful!
Down a little.
Down a little bit!
-Allen wrench. - Allen. Allen.
Allen wrench.
-Allen wrench. - Allen wrench.
My first impression of Ohio was how flat it is.
My family's in China.
Two lovely children and a beautiful wife.
Fuyao offered me my first job at 18.
I've worked in the furnace for more than 20 years.
It's a hard job, but I love it.
Because of the language barrier and cultural differences, it's hard to quickly integrate everyone's ideas.
I don't have much time to eat every day.
So every week, I bring a box of Twinkies.
This is my lunch.
I eat two at a time.
Look at the red sticks. This one is broken.
We have to pull it out by ourselves.
Look at the scars on my arm.
These are all scalds.
I got burned.
Air.
Uh, Wong and I have spent a lot of time together with him teaching me everything... Mother's Day, we spent the whole weekend working together with our little translators, talking back and forth.
That's when they told me that they had to be here two years, away from their family, no extra pay.
That really made me start thinking and appreciating what they're doing for us more and more.
I've ate at their house, they've ate at my home.
We've just bonded.
And we've tried to learn each other's culture.
I got the big idea, Thanksgiving, to... invite my close friends, which should have been about four or five of them.
It ended up being, I think, 13.
Bought a 25-pound turkey, the biggest honey-baked ham I could get, and all of the traditional trimmings.
I know that in China they're not allowed to have guns.
We had my 12-gauge shotgun out there, pistols.
Couple of the very brave ones wanted to go up and down the road with me on my Harley.
They talked about it forever.
That made me happy.
That's the front page of The Washington Post, fellas.
That's big-time.
The only negative thing that I can see from this article is that, out of our 2,000 people, they picked the number one UAW... uh, organizer and sympathizer to talk to.
Number one.
- Anyway, um, it's a big deal. - That's a big deal.
With all of this scrutiny and with all of this visibility comes even more responsibility on us to do things right.
Now the whole world is watching.
Now the whole world is watching us.
It should say have "to be the world."
Yeah, they said they had an S.
Good afternoon.
-Right? -Good afternoon!
Good afternoon.
Thank you guys very much.
You don't know how important this is to Fuyao and to the chairman.
The plant looks great.
These people are coming here to see something that they never in their lifetime thought would happen.
You have given hope and you have given life to a community that was desolate.
This is one of the greatest projects in the history of the United States.
So, be proud, and most importantly, have fun.
Two lands,
-the bridge is what brings us together. -Yeah.
And the niukou. How do you say in English?
-The bond. -Bond. Yeah, bond. Bond.
Yes, bond.
Welcome.
Welcome to the US!
Today the chairman's vision has been fulfilled.
Fuyao has invested close to 500 million.
Ni hao.
Really good seeing you guys. Thank you.
Thanks for having us out here. We really appreciate it.
-It's a big deal. -Absolutely.
This is big. A lot of people.
-Nice weather, man. -Oh, my gosh.
Chairman ordered the weather.
-Oh, I mean, it couldn't be better. -Right.
Hang in there.
-How you doing, Dave? -Good to see you.
"My dear guests and friends, good morning."
"Today, we hold the opening ceremony of Fuyao Glass America."
We've heard both candidates for president refer to Ohio as the Rust Belt.
And, you know, you look at... look at this today, and we reject that term.
With Chairman Cao, we know how to make everything in this state.
And, uh, this is a terrific example.
One last point: I know many workers here are trying to form a union to strengthen their voice in this great company.
Ohio has a rich... a rich, rich history of unions and management working together.
I support those in this community, in this plant, in this crowd that want to vote on whether or not to join a union.
I hope Fuyao looks at it the same way. Thank you all so much.
Who the fuck does he think he is?
Out of place, totally out of place.
Fuck him.
Three, two, one!
Our glass is totally made in USA.
Ladies, you're doing a beautiful job.
Create good glass and transfer good glass.
The senator mentioned the workers union in his speech.
Does Fuyao have any good strategies for avoiding these risks?
Hey, Charles. How you doing, man?
Dave, there's one thing I gotta talk to you about.
Regarding Sherrod Brown's comments... Yes.
You know, that's obviously not beneficial to us.
Absolutely right.
-Don't wanna talk about certain topics. -Correct.
So I think, at this point, Chairman, you know, will definitely ask about
- what we're gonna do about it.  - It's okay. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm gonna have to kill a senator.
I'm gonna take those big scissors and cut the... Senator Brown's head.
He...
-It's big. -He didn't tell us he was gonna do that.
He did that on purpose, so they're cut off.
They'll never be allowed in the plant again.
You all know our stand on this.
We don't want to see the union developing here.
"First, you all know our stand on this, that we want to avoid unions."
If we have a union, it will impact our efficiency, thus hurting our company.
It will create loss for us.
If a union comes in, I'm shutting down.
They keep interfering with my production.
Slowly bleeding money is even worse than a union.
"Uh, right now, if they're creating extreme inefficiency in my production, I'm just bleeding money."
John, if you want to continue to be president, you have to listen to my advice.
Every piece of glass counts.
Every piece that goes down that line and goes... gets on that customer truck, it matters.
Our customers are counting on us.
General Motors, Chrysler, Toyota, Honda.
Whether it's coming from China or whether it's coming from Dayton, it's the same... it's the same thing.
We have to be able to provide them glass at the same level of efficiency, the same level of cost and quality.
It's audit day.
We don't have glass to show them.
We should have some ready for the customers to check.
The glass is gonna run through the furnace, basically the same as the other furnace over here.
This one's just a little bit faster.
So it comes down the line, it comes in here.
Down in here is another one of those free-liners that puts the glass into position.
This is an automatic... Keep it or throw it out?
- Throw out.  - Throw it? Okay.
There must be some flaws if the glass exploded.
The overall quality of the glass is not good enough, but there's no way to improve it now. We still want to achieve our targets.
One is output. The second is rate of finished products.
We need one more person.
Transfer someone from China here.
You have the Chinese, who want numbers on this side.
You have Quality, who wants customer satisfaction on this side.
And we're in the middle.
Today was a shitshow, totally a shitshow.
Any little microscopic chip can cause a breakage.
As soon as it hits the press, it begins to cool.
If there's a... Got it?
Four hundred-and-something degrees.
And they're six feet away from it?
We need to find some solutions, whether it's them stepping into a colder room as soon as they leave there... We've gotta get them some relief.
How much time do you spend in there?
About ten minutes or so.
Ten minutes an hour, a day, a...?
Sometimes every hour.
So every hour? So you go in there, it's about 200 degrees, and you clean up in there for about two hours. All right.
The conditions... are not favorable.
Doing the same thing over and over again.
That wears on you.
Body, mind... You're so... It's... Sometimes you think... "Why am I doing this?"
You think about whether you have the stamina and the will to do this type of job.
Anything they're not happy about?
It gets really hot in here.
Our American colleagues are very afraid of heat.
We try to give them the environment they want, as long as it's within a reasonable budget.
The spaces between the production lines are pretty narrow.
The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) thinks it's too dense.
"A tall tree catches the wind."
Yes, it's a huge tree.
Let's welcome Chairman!
Dear staff, good morning.
We haven't reached our goals.
This is a very tough challenge for us.
We are all Chinese.
We were born of Chinese mothers.
No matter where you die or are buried, you will always be Chinese.
The motherland is like a mother.
This is eternal.
Today, Chinese come to the US to operate factories.
The most important thing is not how much money we earn, but how this will change Americans' views of the Chinese and towards China.
Every Chinese person should do things for our country and our people.
It's down to every one of you here.
American workers are not efficient and output is low.
I can't manage them.
When we try to manage them, they threaten to get help from the union.
How can we make Americans understand that the Chinese can open factories in America?
This is a big problem.
- Hey. Welcome. Thank you.  - Welcome. Nice to see you again.
- How are you? Good?  - Good.
-How are you? -Hi. Welcome.
Ni hao.
- Ni hao. - Pleasure.
Ni hao. Good morning. Pleasure to meet you.
- Good morning. - Good morning.
-Ni hao. -Nice to meet you.
-Thank you. -Good morning.
Nice to meet you.
-Ni hao. -Ni hao.
Ni hao.
Good morning, my name is John Withrow. I'm supervisor in Lamination.
Good morning. I'm Austin Cole.
I'm a temporary backlight production supervisor.
Jon Helton, the continuous improvement supervisor.
Good morning, Darren Noble. Lead supervisor, ARG packaging assembly.
Welcome, everybody.
Welcome home.
The whole world is looking at FGA and you guys are the top guns.
We are investing in the US.
We love the country, and we want to be part of the country and provide benefits to the country.
And we hope that FGA will be profitable soon and to let our customers know that we are a strong company.
This is a very valuable time and also a special time.
Tonight we'll have you join our year-end group party, and, uh, we also hope you can, uh, get some time to taste local cuisines.
Thank you for putting us up in a nice hotel.
Yes.
I think that we are also anxious to see how your process runs and look forward to taking back new ideas and implementations to help us run better as well.
I can't breathe in that.
Nonstop.
- Okay. - Okay.
This is the line they'll run 7,000 on?
We hope someday to get this good.
Attention!
Dress right!
Keep an eye on the distance between yourself and others.
Eyes front!
Straddle.
Hello, everyone!
Good! We are good.
Number off!
-One. -Two.
-Three. -Four.
-Five. -Six.
-Seven. -Eight.
-Nine. -Ten.
Eleven.
-Twelve. -Thirteen.
-Fourteen. -Fifteen.
-Sixteen. -Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen. Report!
There should be 19 people in this team, and all 19 people are here.
Over!
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
- Sorry. - Sorry! Sorry!
- Please. - Please. Please.
- Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you.
Attention.
-Our team name is? - Improvement!
Our slogan is?
To stand still is to move back!
Attention!
The preparation meeting is over.
Dismissed.
I heard things are not going too well over there.
Right. That's true. That's why we're doing training here.
You guys have eight days off every month.
You have all the weekends.
Only eight hours a day. That's an easy life.
Yes.
These workers only have one or two days off per month.
They're not too happy about that.
That's why I told you American workers are too lazy.
It's just your nature. But you're not bad.
-Every person can be changed. -We have some extremely diligent workers.
Very motivated, very ambitious.
They're great.
But most workers are there just to make money, not to make glass.
How many hours a day do they work?
Eight hours per shift.
Eight hours. So about 100 dollars a day.
Here we say you have to be worthy of your salary.
You need to prove you deserve it. You understand, right?
Yes, I understand.
I heard that your workers like to joke around and talk a lot.
The best tool we can use is duct tape.
Put it over their mouths. They will perform better.
-Tape? -Tape on their mouths.
Can you do that there?
No, we can't. But if we could do that, we'd have improved production.
Because they're too chatty now.
Well, the most important thing is that you all should be united and concentrate your efforts.
It's not bad working here.
I'm married.
My child is in my hometown.
We don't have many holidays, so I don't have much time to go back home.
Only during the Spring Festival, once a year.
We work 12 hours a shift.
I'm tired, but I have no choice.
We work whenever we're asked by our leader.
I have two kids now.
One is six months old, the other is four years old.
They're pretty young.
If we're too busy, we may not be able to take days off.
I only go home once or twice a year.
My older kid is 11, and the younger one is eight.
I work long hours and I spend very little time with them.
Holy shit.
They don't have any safety glasses on, nothing. Unbelievable.
Those aren't even cut-resistant gloves.
Man, that is nuts.
You gotta be kidding me.
The glass in our factory... Different glass colors have different values for recycling.
So they have to sort the colors.
These people sit there all day long doing that.
That's fucking crazy. Picking through fucking glass like that.
We are energetic at Fuyao.
All of us are energetic and happy to work here.
All of our workers are members of the workers union.
Mao Zedong, and this is Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping.
These are the five leaders since China was established.
Without backing from the government, the company wouldn't get too far.
Our workers union and the company are closely related to each other.
They are like two gears rotating together.
We need our workers to fight for Fuyao's success.
We are all in the same boat.
Keeping the boat safe means everyone is safe.
If the boat sinks, everyone loses their jobs.
It's quite simple.
Chairman Cao, here is a hada for you.
Next on the red carpet will be workers from two teams.
They have won the Excellent Team award.
Year 2017... "Soaring ambitions."
"The spirit of craftsmanship is all over China."
Let's welcome Chairman Cao with our warmest applause!
Dear Chairman, dear colleagues, tonight is a gathering time for our Fuyao family.
Everybody performing tonight works here at Fuyao.
Come on! Two words have become really popular recently.
What are the words?
Intelligence. Lean.
Uh, we're very impressed, everybody from the United States, with China's operations.
Very harmonious people.
You see it and you feel it.
Please hold the hand of your bride.
From this moment on, no matter poor or rich, you will always care for her, cherish her, and protect her, until forever.
Will you?
- Yes, I will. - Yes, I will.
We're one... big planet.
A world... somewhat divided.
But we're one.
And tonight is an example.
Happy. Happy.
Happy tears.
I'm very happy to share in your culture.
-Thanks so much. -No, thank you.
We are one.
-Yes, we are one. -We are one.
Yes. One tongue, one company.
Yes.
Thank you.
- Aren't watermelons sweet? - Sweet!
Choose the best picture to put on the cover of the next edition of Fuyao People!
This is my community, um, and to see this building come back to life, it meant a lot to me.
Fuyao is the leader, Fuyao is changing the industry, and I see us becoming number one in the world next year and number one in the world every year.
-Yes, sir. How are you doing? - I have a really good idea for you.
Why don't you film those three microwave ovens that have been out for two weeks
-that haven't been replaced? -Okay.
-Why don't you film that? -We will.
And tell me why this area is now gonna be used for production and no longer a lunchroom.
There's signs all over that say that. Where's the lunchroom gonna be?
-I have no clue. You're telling me...  - That's typical.
You're telling me... telling me something new.
I just got back from vacation.
They're gonna take all the tables and all the chairs out and make this a production space. Like everywhere else.
I hope they make your office a production space.
They manage to have these things on all the time. This is America.
We don't need Chinese children singing and praying.
Coming back from the China trip, uh, some of the things I started implementing, Well, the first thing I implemented was, uh... At our pre-shift meeting, we used to just kind of sit at the tables and talk and... watching the Chinese shift meeting, where he had them all lined up... I've found that that's worked out really well for me back here.
Good morning, everybody!
Greg, I need you to stand on two, starting off.
Chuck, I need you standing on three.
I think that's everybody.
It's an experiment.
So, the lines are running okay today?
Uh, everybody got your glasses and boots?
We're good?
Any questions?
Okay, let's have a good day.
- They're gonna do surgery for your hand? - They're gonna tell me tomorrow.
They'll tell you tomorrow what your recovery's gonna be.
Yeah, they'll probably start at four weeks, determine what... you know, how it's gonna be, and then, from there, go to the eight weeks.
I'm worried about my points.
-No, no...  - No, no, no, no.
Don't worry about any of that.
Don't have to worry about your points for missing time.
I don't wanna lose my job.
No, you're not gonna lose your job.
- What's that?  - My pay?
Yes.
It's covered?
Yes. I don't know how all of that works, but it is.
Yeah.
Everybody at every level will say we really, really, really want to be safe.
But safe doesn't pay the bills.
The room that we work in, there's only one way in, no doors on the opposite side.
If a fire breaks out, that's like being trapped.
They're wanting us to pull one of those big sheets off and inspect it.
Some of this float glass is so big that I'm gonna have people exposing their face, and I don't... I don't need to do that.
A couple days ago, I had to tell the Chinese fellow that I absolutely refuse to pick up two loads with a stand-up forklift.
It's not strong enough.
I said, "If you want to do it, that's fine, you do it. I'm not doing it.
I'm not... I'm not risking somebody's life."
Out of all my working life, I have never ever had a workplace injury, ever.
I mean, 15 years at General Motors, you know, never a workplace injury.
And then my new job at Fuyao... what happens?
I get a workplace injury.
Right now, I'm outside the Moraine plant here, off of Kettering Boulevard.
There have been 11 safety complaints filed against Fuyao.
Some workers claim unsafe working conditions and unfair treatment.
I say "people," you say "power."
- People! - Power!
- People! - Power!
I say "people," you say "union."
-People! - Union!
- People! - Union!
All right!
Uh, meeting after work, don't forget, next week.
We'll see you there. Bring your coworkers.
There's a lot of information that you're seeing on TV about Fuyao.
"Safety concerns,"
um, other things that are... are being reported, much of which we do not believe are true.
'Cause if you bring in a union... this becomes illegal.
You cannot do it anymore.
Instead, if I'm an employee, I have to take my concerns to the union rep.
When we had this training in private, I was horrified by this picture.
If this becomes a reality, we wouldn't be able to communicate directly with our American coworkers.
Isn't that terrible?
If we are able to improve our management capabilities, it will help quell the union rebellion.
"And if we are able to improve our management capabilities, it will help with our campaign against union organizations..."
We hired Americans to work as our managers and supervisors.
Our expectation was that we could trust them, pay them a high salary, and they would serve the company.
Why didn't they?
I think they are hostile to Chinese.
The loss from January to October is about 40 million US dollars.
We have to reverse the tide as soon as possible.
With the new restructuring, I believe we will see this plant in profit very soon.
We've invited Jeff Liu to be our new president.
Uh, good morning, everyone.
I was born in 1963, in the Year of the Rabbit.
I've spent 27 years in the US and 26 years in China.
People always guess I am in my 40s, but I'm actually 53.
Why is that? Because I have passion.
I have determination to do things well.
"A major shake-up of the company's senior management team, with company President John Gauthier and Vice President Dave Burrows leaving."
Actually... terminated.
- Got one. - Got one? All right, boss.
Need a hat, Jim?
- Right here. I'll take it.  - All right.
-That's good, brother.  - Merry Christmas to you.
Merry Christmas to you. Thanks for your work.
Hello, everybody!
I would like to use this opportunity to thank each of you for the hard work.
And also, we need to work as a team under one roof, one culture, and make a great year for 2017.
We can turn the company around.
We make more money, and everybody gonna share the piece of pie.
How's that?
Good evening.
You want a hat, Chairman?
He asked if you want a hat.
Of course.
Here you go, boss.
Let me wear a hat.
- Ni hao. -Ni hao, ni hao, ni hao.
-Hello. -Ni hao.
Ni hao.
Someone from work was kind enough to tell me that there were these apartments.
Four hundred and eighty dollars a month.
I fell in love with it.
I can afford to live here and have my own place and feel independent again.
Smells good.
This is the most enjoyable moment in a day.
After I finish the cigarette, my mind just calms down.
We workers lay down tracks so the train can run smoothly.
The only thing we have in mind is to do our best.
That's true for everyone here.
My wife.
My toothache has gone.
They give me so much medicine. I've fully recovered.
The last time I cried, I was a teenager.
And I also cried once after coming here.
I don't dare mention that to other people.
But when all is quiet in the dead of night, I miss my family.
I've learned most of what I learned from Leon and Wong.
None of us knew glass when we came there.
When you get to be my age, not too many people wanna hire you.
They don't wanna take a chance.
My brother, he's my Chinese brother.
I would have his back, just like I'd have one of my own brothers'.
I just... I think the world of him.
Are you okay?
My supervisor started yelling at me.
-When... You work at the table right there. -I was working right here just fine.
-Now he wanna change it right over here. -We know, the table over there.
Now, instead of here, they want you to do it here? Okay.
He said he expects us to do eight boxes at a time.
I just want to make sure you're not gonna get hurt.
He said he want us to push them in here.
Well, now, you-- It's probably too heavy for you to push it.
-So you need to let him know that. -I don't understand.
Sometimes, why she don't know to tell that?
Make sure you're communicating to them that you need help.
I have.
He knows.
Rather than trying to find resolution, they try to find out who's wrong.
And, in this case, they're both wrong.
You need some skills to handle Americans.
How can we take advantage of American characteristics to make them work for Fuyao?
There's a culture in the US where children are showered with encouragement.
So everyone who grows up in the US is overconfident.
They are super confident.
Americans love being flattered to death.
You will get into trouble if you fight with them.
Donkeys like being touched in the direction their hair grows.
Right?
You should touch donkeys in the direction their hair grows.
Otherwise, they'll kick you.
Do you understand what I'm saying? You do? Okay.
We need to use our wisdom to guide them and help them.
Because we are better than them.
They refer to us as "the foreigners."
People just want... They wanna feel like they're in America working, not like, when they walk in the door, that they've left America and they're now in China.
They work nonstop. They're in there all the time.
Around the clock, 24 hours a day. They're in there on Sundays.
There's been some days, they don't want us to take a break for lunch, because they need X amount of glass out.
The Chinese really don't help us out at all.
They just walk around and tell the Americans what to do.
"Just do this." And you're like, "Why?"
They don't tell you why at all, and they walk away.
I know it's a growing company, I know it's new.
But with the workload that comes with it, you know, you wanna keep your employees around, especially your good workers.
A simple pay raise, even if it's just a dollar.
Just show your appreciation for them and their hard work.
Optimism, hope. That was what we were all going in with.
The future looked bright.
Now, it's just... It's a 180.
To me, it's like they don't respect you.
At least 3,000 people have come and gone, either fired or quit.
Whenever you have a frustrating day, you can go outside and... throw your bin over.
Every one of our bosses were demoted.
- Yeah. - The Chinese are in control.
Have the Chinese changed their mind?
Are they not gonna turn this over to us?
Because that was one of the... definitely that was one of the things that intrigued me about coming here.
I love the fact that they came in here. I love this business.
I worked at Appleton for over 20 years and I was one of the guys that got laid off in 2012.
I've been looking for something for four years.
I like working with the people on the floor.
They are working their tails off.
And they're not getting anything for it, and I'm not talking about compensation.
They're not getting patted on the back.
I've seen the Chinese pouring chemicals down the drain out the back of our dock.
Chemicals.
There was a trail of yellow paint going right to the sewer.
- Right out our back door.  - You couldn't miss it.
It... It's like they don't even know what the rules are.
It's... And I'm thinking, "This is all going into the sewer and going into drinking water somewhere."
I don't wanna waste your time and I don't wanna to waste my time.
With what we say at this table, will it make a difference?
I've asked security to come escort you out if you're going to do that.
Okay.
UNION YES Man, they treat these people like shit in there.
Sometimes, you gotta be Sally Field.
If there are things your boss can't fix for you, come talk to me.
Especially how to manage American workers.
Can we force them to work overtime?
- No way! -Not a chance.
From HR's perspective, we can't force them to work overtime.
We can't say anything like that.
But in China, it's mandatory.
The Americans... I don't give a shit what they think.
Go ahead and sue me, but they should come the hell in on Saturdays.
That's how I would do it.
I think the most important thing is mutual understanding.
We're under enormous pressure here.
A lot more pressure than in China.
There was a guy who couldn't fall asleep for a couple of days.
I really admire Americans.
They can work two jobs.
They can have another job besides working here.
I always thought Americans lived a comfortable and superior life.
I thought they didn't have to make any sacrifices.
Good afternoon, everyone.
Good afternoon.
All the stories that you've heard about Fuyao is true.
Just to give you an idea how things are, my daughter does nails for a living.
Last year, she made $13,000 more than I did.
Now, think about that.
She cleared $40,000. I made 27.
Something's wrong with that.
A coworker of mine was fired for being hospitalized for a week and not calling off.
That could've been me. What if I got sick?
Would they fire me?
The man I was working with, the cardboard he was sitting on caught on fire.
And they just kept right on working.
Dayton taxpayers and the state of Ohio have committed tens of millions of dollars to Fuyao, and yet Fuyao management has failed to provide the good and the safe jobs that this community deserves.
Labor.
Working people and the labor movement built America.
It is what made America great the first time.
The working people at Fuyao right now who don't have a... You have a birthright that's paid for by the sweat and blood of people in this room and people who have gone before people in this room, so that you had a right to fair life, to a workplace that was safe.
We fought these battles 70 years ago.
We rejected 70 years ago that management and companies and rich people get to pick and choose what happens to you or what you get or what you don't get.
Nothing in America has changed in terms of working people working hard.
That's not what changed in America.
What changed in America was people at the top deciding they wanted to rewrite the rules to take advantage of people.
To make it in their favor at your expense.
And you have a right and an obligation to say no to that, and that's what unionizing at Fuyao is all about.
And over the course of fighting for this all these years, we found a way for companies to make money and still be fair to employees, and still pay employees a decent wage, and still make sure that they were safe.
These two things can exist together.
As you fight this fight at Fuyao, as UAW stands by you and fights that fight with you, as we show Fuyao that we do things a little bit different in Dayton, Ohio, I will be there every step of the way fighting with you, on the side of UAW, on the side of workers, and we will win this fight. Thank you.
- Morning. - Morning.
Next Monday... everybody already employed in this room, whatever you're paid today, two dollars more.
Thank you.
Everybody, whatever you make today, two dollars more next Monday.
Yeah!
Great?
And the people say, "Why are you doing that? We're losing money."
The good efficiency generate from the good employee.
How do we keep a good employee? Better pay.
We want to be the best employer in this town. But in return... work hard, work longer.
Our team here, we can do the same job as China.
Raise the bar, and I believe the future will belong to everybody.
Thanks again.
Victory!
-We are the union! - We are the union!
-UAW! - UAW!
They don't want to have to abide by the rules and regulations of the United States.
They're in America, and we want to make sure that they abide by the laws in America.
♪ We can bring to birth a new world From the ashes of the old ♪ We have a better chance of having things done fair if we have it written out in a contract.
That's why we need a union.
Management would listen to us because they had to.
Every job I've ever worked on, being a black woman, that's the only way that we have a chance.
I understand that, at times, there's gonna be a need for a union, but right now, I got a man that's given me a good job, given me a good wage, and allowed me to come to work every day.
I don't have any need for somebody else to come in and get in the middle of this.
The only thing the union's gonna do is keep the bad workers.
And the good workers, it's just gonna go along like it is for us.
How's that work for me?
I know there are some union activists here.
I know because I have people who spy for me.
I have many different ways to deal with them.
Here is one. He is pro-union.
This is him. This person here.
Look, we get along pretty well.
You won't see him here in two weeks' time.
Good afternoon.
I want to thank you so much for coming.
I know you didn't have a choice.
The union will go out of their way to try to convince you that it's a good thing for you and that it is in your best interest.
The contract that you get, if you get one, might include better wages and benefits.
That contract might include the same wages and benefits you have today.
And that contract finally might include less wages and less benefits.
And the threat of a strike is no longer scary to employers, because today if you go on strike, while you can't get fired, the employer has the right to permanently replace you.
I'll let that sink in.
You can't get fired for going on strike, but you can get permanently replaced.
So are you telling us not to vote for the union?
I'm here to tell you to do what you want.
I got a question. Who do you work for?
I work for a company called Labor Relations Institute.
We're a labor consulting firm.
- Is the company paying you? - Yes.
Didn't I say that? I usually say that in every meeting.
- No. - No, you didn't say that yet.
Well, the reality is, they pay me to consult with you here... They pay you to talk to us?
They pay me. They don't pay me enough to stand up here and lie to you.
Okay?
He says that he was being impartial, but he wasn't.
The UAW is free to use everywhere else in the world.
If they want to pay our... pay our workforce to sit through a presentation, to listen to the pitch, that's their right.
But while they're on our clock, it's our message.
They spent a lot of money to bring these people in here to make sure that every employee goes through this session, not once, but twice, maybe three times.
They have people walking around there with patches and stickers on that's saying: "Vote no.
You still have a voice."
Now, my question to them people are:
What voice do you have?
When have you ever had a voice?
Ever since they started this job, it's been a two-man job.
When they put me out here on it, they decided they wanted it to be a one-person job.
When I went to talk to HR, I told them they were targeting me.
Put me on a job to set me up to write me up for performance issues and fire me.
I got the phone call from Fuyao that they had fired me.
I really truly feel like... that they targeted me.
I was on the news, I was at the city council meetings.
It's been a pretty sad... few days.
This sinking feeling of... "I don't have a job."
I mean, I'm a good worker.
Workers union!
Should I have gotten so involved?
Put my whole life into it?
Here's old Fuyao.
Can't spell Fuyao without F-U.
When I was at Fuyao, I didn't think we needed a union.
Move forward to today, you have no voice, you have... Truly, you... From what I'm told, there really isn't an American with authority that they can talk to.
You know, I... I think these employees need something.
I think I need to make only two more trips this year, if you achieve what you planned.
Why do I need to come here? It's not convenient for me. Right?
You think I like to come to America every month?
It's tiring.
Is the union making any noise?
No, not too much.
Better than it was before.
Recently, we fired a lot of union supporters.
We have tried different ways. It's worked out.
A lot of active ones left... Then you guys should hire more excellent people.
Young people.
This is the culture I want for our company.
Then we will have a good atmosphere here.
A lot of things here in the US are different from China.
Well, we've invested here already. It's just not working that well.
Morning, y'all.
-Fired up, ready to vote. -Ready to win!
-Ready to vote. -Ready to win.
-Ready to win! -There you go.
-You ready to win. - All right, girl!
Fired up, ready to win!
These are actually people from the United Auto Workers Union, and they're out here demonstrating, trying to encourage Fuyao employees to vote "yes."
Fuyao released a statement earlier saying that they believe the United Workers Union is corrupted and they hope that the workers vote "no."
More than 1,500 workers are expected... We all have a psychological shadow.
Fuyao doesn't want to be controlled by the union.
As the Chinese saying goes, "One mountain cannot hold two tigers."
Voting just ended an hour ago.
Now the National Labor Relations Board is counting those votes inside the plant with both Fuyao and UAW watching... Yes!
We won by a landslide.
We won 60%?
Right.
We're awesome!
868 noes, 444 yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I wasn't shocked... because I know the... the young people got scared.
Them LRI people scared the shit out of 'em, that's all.
Before we started having those trainings, I felt like there was a big "yes" vote.
They spoke a lot about a strike, and like, not being able to be paid, unless we... You know.
So, I feel like people, you know, are worried about their income.
'Cause I definitely was, you know? So... There you have it. Overwhelming no.
Good morning, everyone.
Morning.
Last night I couldn't sleep because I feel... even more heavier burden on my shoulder.
You guys gave me a chance to make FGA better.
My goal is gonna work with the team to make sure every single issue I cannot resolve overnight, but give me some time.
Can we do this?
Yeah?
All right, one more thing: life is short.
We're gonna select the best ten employees go to China.
There's some pictures.
This is Shanghai.
Shanghai is the most modern city in China.
Look like Manhattan, right?
It's like a Manhattan too.
Yeah, this is a Hyatt Hotel. Hyatt Hotel.
They have a sky pool, 55 floor.
You swim in the sky.
And I'm gonna share the good news for you.
One of you lucky guys, you're gonna see that city.
We're one Fuyao, one family.
We create the miracle.
We need to create success forever.
Let's make American great again.
The smooth operation of our US project has laid a solid foundation for our global strategy.
We've achieved double-digit growth in operation management.
Both our earnings and profits have reached new digits.
The China of my youth was poor and undeveloped.
I feel I was happier then.
Now I live in a new era of prosperity and modernity, but I have a sense of loss.
I miss the croaking frogs and chirping bugs of my childhood.
The wild flowers blooming in the field.
In the past few decades, I have built so many factories.
Have I taken the peace away and destroyed the environment?
I don't know if I am a contributor or a sinner.
But... I only think that way when I'm unhappy.
The point of living is to work.
Don't you think so?
Last Friday, I was terminated from Fuyao after two and a half years.
The excuse given was I was too slow pulling up something on the computer.
Took me about two or three minutes.
It wasn't quick enough.
I wouldn't take away the last two and a half years.
I met a lot of good friends and I learned a lot from the Chinese.
I don't have any food for you.
I have some watermelon in my apartment.
I don't think he can eat fruit.
He can eat grass.
- Take care, guys. - See you later.
- Bye, Wong. -Bye-bye.
In the old days, all Chinese people wanted in life was to have enough food and to raise their kids.
That's all they wanted.
When it comes to my generation, we want it all.
We travel wherever we want and buy whatever we like.
GM afforded me a great life... that was cut off when they closed the doors.
We will never ever make that type of money again.
Those days are over.
There you go!
All right!
Well, I didn't even know.
You never give up on the American dream.
To me, that would be un-American.
I can have that white fence.
I can have that nice home.
Send my children to college if that's what they want to do.
Get treated with common decency.
You have to be able to believe in it.
We used to have one person here.
Now we don't have anyone.
Next, I'm going to get rid of four workers here.
Two for each line.
Automation means standardization.
After we finish this, we will have two fewer workers uploading on the encapsulation line.
The mechanical arms do that instead.
You have already finished that?
Yes. These are all automatic.
And you're replacing the rest with mechanical arms too?
Yes. I will replace the ones on side-window tempering.
This one is being tested now.
We're hoping to cancel four workers in July or August.
I'll change that into machine work.
We can't get the work done now. They are too slow.
The way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000.
But the image that's used to sell the food, it is still the imagery of agrarian America.
You go into the supermarket and you see pictures of farmers, the picket fence, the silo, the '30s farmhouse and the green grass.
It's the spinning of this pastoral fantasy.
The modern American supermarket has on average 47,000 products.
There are no seasons in the American supermarket.
Now there are tomatoes all year round, grown halfway around the world, picked when it was green, and ripened with ethylene gas.
Although it looks like a tomato, it's kind of a notional tomato.
I mean, it's the idea of a tomato.
In the meat aisle, there are no bones anymore.
There is this deliberate veil, this curtain, that's dropped between us and where our food is coming from.
The industry doesn't want you to know the truth about what you're eating, because if you knew, you might not want to eat it.
If you follow the food chain back from those shrink-wrapped packages of meat, you find a very different reality.
The reality is a factory.
It's not a farm. It's a factory.
That meat is being processed by huge multinational corporations that have very little to do with ranches and farmers.
Now our food is coming from enormous assembly lines where the animals and the workers are being abused.
And the food has become much more dangerous in ways that are being deliberately hidden from us.
You've got a small group of multinational corporations who control the entire food system.
From seed to the supermarket, they're gaining control of food.
This isn't just about what we're eating.
This is about what we're allowed to say, what we're allowed to know.
It's not just our health that's at risk.
The companies don't want farmers talking.
They don't want this story told.
How about a nice chicken club sandwich made with fresh cooked chicken?
You know, that's a nice idea, but I think what I'd really like is a burger. All right.
My favorite meal to this day remains a hamburger and french fries.
I had no idea that a handful of companies had changed what we eat and how we make our food.
I've been eating this food all my life without having any idea where it comes from, any idea how powerful this industry is.
And it was the idea of this world deliberately hidden from us.
I think that's one of the reasons why I became an investigative reporter, was to take the veil-- lift the veil away from important subjects that are being hidden.
The whole industrial food system really began with fast food.
In the 1930s, a new form of restaurant arose and it was called the drive-in.
The McDonald brothers had a very successful drive-in, but they decided to cut costs and simplify.
So they fired all their carhops, they got rid of most of the things on the menu and they created a revolutionary idea to how to run a restaurant.
They basically brought the factory system to the back of the restaurant kitchen.
They trained each worker to just do one thing again and again and again.
By having workers who only had to do one thing, they could pay them a low wage and it was very easy to find someone to replace them.
It was inexpensive food, it tasted good and this McDonald's fast food restaurant was a huge huge success.
That mentality of uniformity, conformity and cheapness applied widely and on a large scale has all kinds of unintended consequences.
When McDonald's is the largest purchaser of ground beef in the United States and they want their hamburgers to taste, everywhere, exactly the same, they change how ground beef is produced.
The McDonald's corporation is the largest purchaser of potatoes and one of the largest purchasers of pork, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, even apples.
These big big fast food chains want big suppliers.
And now there are essentially a handful of companies controlling our food system.
In the 1970s, the top five beef-packers controlled only about 25% of the market.
Today, the top four control more than 80% of the market.
You see the same thing happening now in pork.
Even if you don't eat at a fast food restaurant, you're now eating meat that's being produced by this system.
You look at the labels and you see Farmer this, Farmer that it's really just three or four companies that are controlling the meat.
We've never had food companies this big and this powerful in our history.
Tyson, for example, is the biggest meat-packing company in the history of the world.
The industry changed the entire way that chicken are raised.
Birds are now raised and slaughtered in half the time they were 50 years ago, but now they're twice as big.
People like to eat white meat, so they redesigned the chicken to have large breasts.
They not only changed the chicken, they changed the farmer.
Today, chicken farmers no longer control their birds.
A company like Tyson owns the birds from the day they're dropped off until the day that they're slaughtered.
Let me go to the top.
This is the Chicken.National Chicken Council.
The chicken industry has really set a model for the integration of production, processing and marketing of the products that other industries are now following because they see that we have achieved tremendous economies.
In a way, we're not producing chickens; we're producing food.
It's all highly mechanized.
So all the birds coming off those farms have to be almost exactly the same size.
What the system of intensive production accomplishes is to produce a lot of food on a small amount of land at a very affordable price.
Now somebody explain to me what's wrong with that?
Smells like money to me.
16 chicken houses sit here.
And Chuck's son has four over the top of this hill.
The chicken industry came in here and it's helped this whole community out.
Here's my chicken houses here.
I have about 300,000 chickens.
What do you want?
We have a contract with Tyson.
They've been growing chickens for many many years.
It's all a science. They got it figured out.
If you can grow a chicken in 49 days, why would you want one you gotta grow in three months?
More money in your pocket.
These chickens never see sunlight.
They're pretty much in the dark all the time.
So you think they just want to keep us out?
I don't know.
If I knew, I'd tell you.
It would be nice if y'all could see what we really do, but as far as y'all going in, we can't let you do that.
I understand why farmers don't want to talk because the company can do what it wants to do as far as pay goes since they control everything.
But it's just gotten to the point that it's not right what's going on and I've just made up my mind.
I'm gonna say what I have to say.
I understand why others don't want to do it.
And I'm just to a point that it doesn't matter anymore.
Something has to be said.
It is nasty in here.
There's dust flying everywhere.
There's feces everywhere.
This isn't farming.
This is just mass production, like an assembly line in a factory.
When they grow from a chick and in seven weeks you've got a five-and-a-half- pound chicken, their bones and their internal organs can't keep up with the rapid growth.
A lot of these chickens here, they can take a few steps and then they plop down. It's because they can't keep up all the weight that they're carrying.
That's normal.
There's antibiotics that's put into the feed and of course that passes through the chicken.
The bacteria builds up a resistance, so antibiotics aren't working anymore.
I have become allergic to all antibiotics and can't take them.
When it's dark inside the houses, the chickens lay down. It's less resistance when they're being caught.
Traditionally, it's been African-American men.
Now we're seeing more and more Latino catchers undocumented workers.
From their point of view, they don't have any rights and they're just not gonna complain.
The companies like these kind of workers.
It doesn't matter if the chickens get sick.
All of the chickens will go to the plant for processing.
The companies keep the farmers under their thumb because of the debt that the farmers have.
To build one poultry house is anywhere from $280,000 to $300,000 per house.
And once you make your initial investment, the companies constantly come back with demands of upgrades for new equipment, and the grower has no choice.
They have to do it or you're threatened with loss of a contract.
This is how they keep the farmers under control.
It's how they keep them spending money, going to the bank and borrowing more money.
The debt just keeps building.
To have no say in your business, it's degrading.
It's like being a slave to the company.
The idea that you would need to write a book telling people where their food came from is just a sign of how far removed we've become.
It seems to me that we're entitled to know about our food who owns it? How are they making it?
Can I have a look in the kitchen?
When I wanted to understand the industrial food system, what I set about doing was very simple.
I wanted to trace the source of my food.
When you go through the supermarket, what looks like this cornucopia of variety and choice is not.
There is an illusion of diversity.
There are only a few companies involved and there're only a few crops involved.
What really surprised me most as I followed that food back to its source, I kept ending up in the same place, and that was a cornfield in Iowa.
So much of our industrial food turns out to be clever rearrangements of corn.
Corn has conquered the world in a lot of ways.
It is a remarkable plant.
100 years ago, a farmer in America could grow maybe 20 bushels of corn on an acre.
Today, 200 bushels is no problem.
That's an astonishing achievement for which breeders deserve credit, for which fertilizer makers deserve credit, for which pesticide makers all deserve credit.
In the United States today, 30% of our land base is being planted to corn.
That's largely driven by government policy, government policy that, in effect, allows us to produce corn below the cost of production.
The truth of the matter is we're paid to overproduce, and it was caused by these large multinational interests.
The reason our government's promoting corn the Cargills, the ADMs, Tyson, Smithfield they have an interest in purchasing corn below the cost of production.
They use that interest and that extensive amount of money they have to lobby Congress to give us the kind of farm bills we now have.
"farm bill,"
which should really be called a "food bill,"
codifies the rules of the entire food economy.
Farm policy is always focused on these commodity crops because you can store them.
We encourage farmers to grow as much corn as they can grow, to get big, to consolidate.
We subsidize farmers by the bushel.
We produced a lot of corn and they came up with uses for it.
We are now engineering our foods.
We know where to turn to for certain traits like mouth feel and flavor.
And we bring all of these pieces together and engineer new foods that don't stale in the refrigerator, don't develop rancidity.
Of course the biggest advance in recent years was high-fructose corn syrup.
I would venture to guess if you go and look on the supermarket shelf, I'll bet you 90% of them would contain either a corn or soybean ingredient, and most of the time will contain both.
Corn is the great raw material.
You get that big fat kernel of starch and you can break that down and reassemble it.
You can make high-fructose corn syrup.
You can make maltodextrin and diglycerides and xanthan gum and ascorbic acid.
All those obscure ingredients on the processed food it's remarkable how many of them can be made from corn.
Plus, you can feed it to animals.
Corn is the main component in feed ingredients whether it's chicken, hogs, cattle you name it.
Increasingly, we're feeding the corn to the fish whether we're eating the tilapia or the farmed salmon.
We're teaching fish how to eat corn.
The fact that we had so much cheap corn really allowed us to drive down the price of meat.
I mean, the average American is eating over 200 lbs of meat per person per year.
That wouldn't be possible had we not fed them this diet of cheap grain.
Since you're selling corn at below the price of production, the feedlot operator can buy corn at a fraction of what it costs to grow, so that all the animals are sucked off of all the farms in the Midwest.
There is a spiderweb of roads and train tracks all around the country moving corn from where it's being grown to these CAFOs.
Cows are not designed by evolution to eat corn.
They're designed by evolution to eat grass.
And the only reason we feed them corn is because corn is really cheap and corn makes them fat quickly.
Where are you putting your hand?
I'm actually inside the rumen that first compartment of the stomach.
it's kind of hard to see.
You can see the liquid part here.
Wow.
Does that hurt the cow? No.
There's microorganisms bacteria in the rumen, millions of them.
The animals evolved on consuming grass.
There's some research that indicates that a high-corn diet results in E. coli that are acid-resistant.
And these would be the more harmful E. coli.
So you feed corn to cattle and E. coli, which is a very common bug, evolves, a certain mutation occurs and a strain called the "E. coli 0157:h7"
appears on the world stage.
And it's a product of the diet we're feeding cattle on feedlots and it's a product of feedlot life.
The animals stand ankle deep in their manure all day long.
So if one cow has it, the other cows will get it.
When they get to the slaughterhouse, their hides are caked with manure.
And if the slaughterhouse is slaughtering 400 animals an hour, how do you keep that manure from getting onto those carcasses?
And that's how the manure gets in the meat.
And now this thing that wasn't in the world is in the food system.
A fast-food nightmare may be getting worse.
A two-year-old child died today in Seattle.
And the killer? Tainted meat from Jack In The Box hamburgers.
A nationwide recall today for more than 140 tons of ground beef.
A half a million pounds of ground beef.
Today, nationwide recalls of Con Agra ground beef.
Schlosser: E. coli isn't just in ground beef now, it's been found in spinach, apple juice and this is really because of the runoff from our factory farms.
90 confirmed cases of E. coli poisoning.
Central to it all raw, bagged spinach.
This is the 20th E. coli outbreak with leafy greens in just the last decade.
For years during the Bush administration, the chief of staff at the USDA was the former chief lobbyist to the beef industry in Washington.
The head of the F.D.A. was the former executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association.
These regulatory agencies are being controlled by the very companies that they're supposed to be scrutinizing.
ConAgra, which recently recalled peanut butter contaminated with salmonella, was aware of problems in its plant two years ago.
There's always been food poisoning.
As more and more technology is being applied to the production of food, you would think it would be getting safer, not more contaminated.
But the processing plants have gotten bigger and bigger.
It's just perfect for taking bad pathogens and spreading them far and wide.
The recall of frozen hamburger now includes 22 million pounds.
Enough meat to make a fast-food hamburger for every adult in America is being recalled.
In the 1970s, there were literally thousands of slaughterhouses in the United States.
Today we have 13 slaughterhouses that process the majority of beef that is sold in the United States.
The hamburger of today, it has pieces of thousands of different cattle ground up in that one hamburger patty.
The odds increase exponentially that one of those animals was carrying a dangerous pathogen.
It's remarkable how toothless our regulatory agencies are when you look closely at it, and that's how the industry wants it.
This is the USDA building up here.
Did Josh say how much time he thought we'd get?
- Five minutes. - Five minutes.
Well, maybe as much as 15. Got to be on time for that meeting.
- It starts a 4:00. - Okay.
So if I start going like that or start shuffling papers, it's time. - I know, it's time.
Thank you! Thank you.
I'm a registered Republican.
I've always been fairly conservative.
I never thought I would be doing this and I certainly never thought I would be working so closely with my mom.
- We go this way? Okay. - Yes, we go this way.
Made a mistake,I think that's the way we want to go.
My mom and I, our relationship has taken on a whole new dimension.
Here we are.
- Hi. - Hello.
- How are you? - I'm Pat.
- Hi, Pat. - Barb Kowalcyk.
- Hi, Barb. - After the first big push to establish food standards, people just got complacent.
We reduced funding for the FDA.
We've relied increasingly on self-policing for all of these industries.
And now we just have, really, lost our system.
You're really one of the champions on the hill for food safety and it's a very important cause.
It's very personal to me and my family.
Our food safety advocacy work started six years ago when my two-and- a-half-year-old son Kevin was stricken with E. coli 0157:h7 and went from being a perfectly healthy beautiful little boy and I have a small picture with me today that was taken two weeks before he got sick.
He went from that to being dead in 12 days.
In July 2001, our family took a vacation.
Had we known what was in store for us, we would have never gone home.
We ended up eating three hamburgers before he got sick.
We started to see blood in Kevin's diarrhea, so we took him to the emergency room.
They came in and informed us that Kevin's kidneys were starting to fail.
Kevin received his first dialysis treatment.
He was not allowed to really drink water.
We had these little sponges and we were allowed to dip that into a cup of water and then give him that.
He bit the head off of one of them.
You've never seen someone beg.
He begged for water. It was all he could talk about.
They wouldn't let anybody bring any beverage into the room because I mean, it was all he would talk about, was water.
I don't know if he knew what was happening to him and I hope I don't know.
To watch this beautiful child go from being perfectly healthy to dead in 12 days it was just unbelievable that this could happen from eating food.
What was kind of adding more insult to injury it took us almost two or three years and hiring a private attorney to actually find out that we matched a meat recall.
On August 1st, my son was already in the hospital.
They did an E. coli test at the plant that was positive.
They didn't end up recalling that meat until August 27th, 16 days after he died.
If we have some more hearings which I'm sure we will I'd love to have you come and testify.
-Keep fighting. -Thank you.
You never get over the death of your child.
You find a new normal.
-This way? - Yes.
We're going this way?
We put faith in our government to protect us, and we're not being protected at a most basic level.
In 1998, the USDA implemented microbial testing for salmonella and E. coli 0157:h7.
The idea was that if a plant repeatedly failed these tests, that the USDA would shut the plant down because they obviously had an ongoing contamination problem.
The meat and poultry associations immediately took the USDA to court.
The courts basically said the USDA didn't have the authority to shut down the plants.
What it meant was that you could have a pound of meat or poultry products that is a petri dish of salmonella and the USDA really can't do anything about it.
A new law was introduced in direct response and this law became known as Kevin's Law.
It seems like such a clear-cut, common sense type thing.
- How are things going? - Fine fine.
We've been working for six years and it still hasn't passed.
I sense that there may be an enhanced opportunity to get this signed into law this time.
I think that from the standpoint of the consumer, a lot of people would support the idea of paying a little more if they could be guaranteed a higher standard of safety.
-Yeah. -But I also know that there are other players
-in the food production chain. -We know.
That tend to worry about that, because it's gonna be seen as an add-on to their costs.
I think the advantage here is sometimes it does feel like industry was more protected than my son.
That's what motivated me to become an advocate.
In the past year alone, there have been a multitude of food-borne illness outbreaks which have resulted in significant losses.
Clearly our current approach to food oversight and protection is not meeting the needs of American families.
It's really hard for me to tell Kevin's story.
But the only way I'm going to be able to prevent it from happening to other people is to go out there and speak about it.
Yeah.
Six are elementary school students, one is a sibling, and there's another one in another county in Kentucky, so it will be seven years since my son died.
All I wanted the company to do was say we're sorry.
We produced this defective product that killed your child, and this is what we're going to do to make sure it doesn't happen again.
That's all we wanted, and they couldn't give us that.
The industrial food system is always looking for greater efficiency, but each new step in efficiency leads to problems.
If you take feedlot cattle off of their corn diet, give them grass for five days, they will shed 80% of the E. coli in their gut.
But of course that's not what the industry does.
The industry's approach is when it has a systematic problem like that is not to go back and see what's wrong with the system, it's to come up some high-tech fixes that allow the system to survive.
The 5x5 product surge tank low level. Low level.
This is our operations center.
We control all of our plants from here.
Where's Chicago? Here's Chicago, Georgia, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, L.A., Ohio.
We control all levels of the gearboxes, the speed of motors we can change those all from here.
We built something that from a food-safety standpoint, we think we're ahead of everybody.
We think we can lessen the incidents of E. coli 0157:h7.
But I just started working with ammonia and ammonia hydroxide.
Ammonia kills bacteria, so it became a processing tool.
I'm really a mechanic.
That's really what I am.
We design our own machinery.
This is our finished product.
Is your meat in most of the hamburgers in the country?
In five years, we think we'll be in 100%.
We do have some competitors.
I think we're gonna beat them.
Again, it's a marriage of science and technology.
I want dollar meal five rodeo cheeseburgers. -Five rodeos. Okay.
Two chicken sandwich.
-Anything else? -Two small drinks, and give me a large Dr. Pepper.
Thank you.
First window. Thank you.
We didn't even think about healthy eating because we used to think everything was healthy.
-Here you go. -Thank you.
- Have a nice day. - You too. Thank you very much.
Now that I know that the food is really unhealthy for us, I feel guilty giving it to my kids.
But we don't have time to cook because we leave at 6:00.
We don't get home until 9:00, 10:00 at night.
When you have only a dollar to spend and you have two kids to feed, either you go to the market and try to find something that's cheap or just go straight through a drive-thru and get two small hamburgers for them and "Okay, here. Eat them."
This is what's gonna fill her up, not that one single item at the market.
Look at the broccoli.
It's too expensive.
What do you want to eat then?
First check to see how many are there for a pound.
We're not getting it. -Why not?
You'd only get two or three.
We can find candy that's cheaper.
We can find chips that are cheaper.
The sodas are really cheap.
Sometimes you look at a vegetable and say we can get two hamburgers over here for the same amount of price.
Why is it that you can buy a double-cheeseburger at McDonald's for 99, and you can't even get a head of broccoli for 99?
You want the small one? We've skewed our food system to the bad calories and it's not an accident.
I mean, the reasons that those calories are cheaper is because those are the ones we're heavily subsidizing.
And this is directly tied to the kind of agriculture that we're practicing and the kind of farm policies we have.
All those snack-food calories are the ones that come from the commodity crops from the wheat, from the corn and from the soybeans.
By making those calories really cheap, that's one of the reasons that the biggest predictor of obesity is income level.
Over the course of human history, we were struggling to make sure we had enough food and enough calories for a sizable percentage of the human race.
Now the problem is too many calories.
The industry blames obesity on a crisis of personal responsibility.
But when you're engineering foods you are pressing our evolutionary buttons.
The fact is we're hardwired to go for three tastes salt, fat and sugar.
These things are very rare in nature.
Now sugar is available 24/7 in tremendous quantities.
We're eating hundreds of pounds of the stuff a year.
This diet of high-fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates leads to these spikes of insulin and, gradually, a wearing down of the system by which our body metabolizes sugar.
My husband's diabetic.
One of my main concerns is he could lose his sight.
He does get into sometimes he's shaking, so I'm afraid that he's gonna start not being able to drive, because that's what he does for a profession.
We have to consider his medicine.
What is it, $70?
50 pills costs me about $130.
But he's on two different types of pills.
$100-and-something for one pill and then $100- and-something for another.
That takes a lot of our income away.
We're really tight from either paying for his medicine to be healthy or buying vegetables to be healthy.
So which one should we do?
It's hard to see my dad suffer with diabetes and stuff like that.
And it's really sad to see that my sister might have it.
There's something that's going on in the way that we live our lives, where we play, where we buy our food and the types of food that we're able to buy that is causing this epidemic.
It's not just our community.
It's not just Baldwin Park. It's everywhere.
How many of us know one person in our family with diabetes?
How about two?
Three? Keep your hand.
It used to be that type 2 diabetes only affected adults.
And now it's affecting children at epidemic proportions.
Everything we've done in modern industrial agriculture is to grow it faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper.
Nobody's thinking about E. coli, type 2 diabetes and the ecological health of the whole system.
We're outsourcing autonomous farmer decision making we're outsourcing that to corporate boardrooms in big cities 1,000 miles away where people make decisions and don't live with the consequences of those decisions.
Everything is grass based.
You know, they don't eat corn, dead cows or chicken manure like they feed right here in the valley or dead chickens.
They actually eat grass, forage clover, grass, herbs.
They're herbivores.
If they were eating corn, you're gonna have to harvest that corn, transport that corn, then you're gonna have to haul all that manure somewhere that comes out the back end.
Here it is.
There is the whole thing.
I mean the cow is she's fertilizing.
She's mowing. We don't have to spread any manure.
We don't have to harvest it she's harvesting it.
It's all real time real solar dollars.
The industrial food system gradually became so noisy, smelly, not a person-friendly place, that the people who operate those plants don't want anybody to go there, because then people would see the ugly truth.
When that occurred, then we lost all the integrity and all the accountability in the food system.
If we put glass walls on all the megaprocessing facilities, we would have a different food system in this country.
We have allowed ourselves to become so disconnected and ignorant about something that is as intimate as the food that we eat.
What a difference this is to be out here in the fresh air, sunshine, birds singing in the trees.
But you see, according to the U.S.D.A, this is unsanitary because it's open to the air.
They tried to close us down.
One of the biggest showdowns we had was when they tried to close us down because this was unsanitary.
Can you imagine?
So we had them cultured at a local microbiology lab.
Ours averaged 133 C.F.U and the ones from the store averaged 3600.
Of course, those have been through 40 trillion baths.
Ours haven't seen any chlorine.
A lot of people wonder is this real?
Can you really feed the world?
That whole thing is such a specious argument because we're every bit as efficient, especially if you plug in all of the inefficiencies of the industrial system.
I've had people come up at farmer's markets and say "What? $3 a dozen for eggs?"
I'm always struck by how successful we have been at hitting the bull's-eye of the wrong target.
I mean we have learned for example, in cattle we have learned how to plant, fertilize and harvest corn using global positioning satellite technology, and nobody sits back and asks should we be feeding cows corn?
We've become a culture of technicians.
We're all into the how of it and nobody's stepping back and saying "But why?"
I mean, a culture that just views a pig as a pile of protoplasmic inanimate structure to be manipulated by whatever creative design that humans can foist on that critter will probably view individuals within its community and other cultures in the community of nations with the same type of disdain, disrespect and controlling-type mentality.
The town where the plant is located is a small town called Tar Heel in the middle of a very economically-depressed area.
Smithfield has mastered the art of picking and choosing a workforce that they can exploit, initially from the local workforce the poor whites, the poor black.
They went through that workforce very quickly.
Now they have to bus their workers all the way from Dentsville, South Carolina, to Clinton, North Carolina.
You have to draw a circle 100 miles in diameter, and that's where all of your workers are coming from.
They have the same mentality towards workers as they do towards the hogs.
You know, the hog, they don't really have to worry about their comfort because they're temporary. They're gonna be killed.
And they have the same viewpoint to the worker.
You're not worried about the longevity of the worker because, to them, everything has an end.
When you've got 2000 hogs an hour going through employees, because they're handling these guts so much, they get infections in their fingernails and all.
All their fingernails separate from their fingers.
You're covered with blood, feces, urine.
It's easy to get hurt down there.
You're doing that same movement for that same piece of the hog and it's nonstop.
Basically you're treated as a human machine.
You get people that can't afford to leave from out there, and Smithfield knows this.
And that's what they hold over you.
Schlosser: 100 years ago when Upton Sinclair wrote "The Jungle"
there was a beef trust that wielded enormous power.
Immigrants from Eastern Europe were being abused in the absence of any kind of government regulation.
There were horrible disfiguring injuries and even deaths.
Teddy Roosevelt took on the beef trust.
Labor unions slowly organized meatpacking workers and turned it into one of the best industrial jobs in the United States.
By the 1950s to be a meatpacking worker was like being an auto worker who has a good wage, good benefits, pension.
And then what happened?
The meat-packing companies got bigger in order to serve the needs of the fast-food industry, which was its biggest customer.
Some of the meat-packing companies like IBP borrowed the same sort of labor practices from the fast food industry cutting wages, making sure there were no unions, speeding up production, and having the worker do the same task again and again and again.
And meat-packing is now one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States.
The meat-packing industry also recruited a new set of immigrants illegal immigrants and recent immigrants from Mexico.
Many of the illegal immigrants coming to America were corn farmers in Mexico.
NAFTA led to a flooding of the Mexican market with cheap American corn.
It's put more than a million and a half Mexican farmers out of work.
They couldn't compete with this cheap corn coming from America.
So what happens to those million and a half Mexican farmers?
Meat packers like IBP, National Beef and Monfort began actively recruiting in Mexico.
Companies advertised on the radio and in newspapers.
IBP set up a bus service in Mexico to bring workers into the United States.
For years the government turned a blind eye to the recruitment of immigrants by the meat-packing industry.
But now, when there's an anti-immigrant movement, they're cracking down all of a sudden, but they're not cracking down on these companies.
The government's cracking down on the workers.
Immigration agents are arresting Smithfield workers at this trailer park.
This is an agreement between Smithfield and Immigrations authorities.
They get rid of 15 workers per day, but you don't see any massive raids.
That way it doesn't affect the production line.
She asked me a question.
She is asking us questions, not you.
I don't see anybody arresting no Smithfield managers.
Nobody in the plant that had anything to do with the fact that those workers were hired is being arrested.
What we see today is workers who were producing for this company and working hard those are the people who get arrested.
We want to pay the cheapest price for our food.
We don't understand that that comes at a price.
These workers, they've been here for 10, 15 years processing your bacon, your holiday ham and now they're getting picked up like they're criminals.
And these companies are making billions of dollars.
Is cheapness everything that there is?
Who wants to buy the cheapest car?
We're willing to subsidize the food system to create the "mystique"
of cheap food, when actually it's very expensive food when you add up the environmental costs societal costs, health costs.
The industrial food is not honest food.
It's not priced honestly. It's not produced honestly.
It's not processed honestly.
There's nothing honest about that food.
I can't think of a better use for a Smithfield box.
It was about a five-hour drive maybe 300, 400 miles.
I have no desire to scale up or get bigger.
My desire is to produce the best food in the world and heal.
And if in doing so more people come to our corner and want stuff, then heaven help me figure out how to meet the need without compromising the integrity.
That's where I am.
I have absolutely no desire to be at Wal-Mart.
As soon as you grasp for that growth, you're gonna view your customer differently, you're gonna view your product differently, you're gonna view your business differently.
You're gonna view everything that is the most important you're gonna view that differently.
This is our new organic line of popcorn.
This is Vitasoy soy milk, the best soy milk in the entire world.
This entire show when it first started was the size of this column right here.
Several of us were sleeping in our booths.
We couldn't afford hotel rooms.
Organic's been growing over 20% annually.
It's one of the fastest-growing segments in the food industry.
We're not gonna get rid of capitalism.
Certainly we're not gonna get rid of it in the time that we need to arrest global warming and reverse the toxification of our air, our food and our water.
We need to be much more urgent.
If we attempt to make perfect the enemy of the good and say we're only going to buy food from the most-perfect system within 100 miles of us, we're never gonna get there.
As an environmentalist, it was pretty clear to me that business was the source of all the pollution, business was the source of basically all the things that were destroying this world.
In college I came across this little institute called New Alchemy Institute, which was a group of renegade biologists.
We were preaching a kind of a new religion, trying to develop food and waste-treatment alternatives, but we were preaching to the convinced.
We were depending on sources of support that were dried up and we weren't reaching the audience that really needed these messages.
I realized we need to not be David up against Goliath,we need to be Goliath.
When we started out, we were a seven-cow farm.
We wanted to prove that business could be part of the solution to the globe's environmental problems.
At the same time we had to prove that we could be highly profitable.
Today in 2008, not only are we the third yogurt brand in America, but we're among the most profitable.
See, this is the interesting thing.
A little company like this is now Kraft, but you don't have any idea that it's Kraft.
This is now Pepsi. That's now Kellogg's.
-Kashi is Kellogg's? -Yeah.
-This is Colgate now. - Oh, is it?
Yeah, this is one of those companies that started like us.
Make them different?
Make them successful, basically.
These large companies don't grow organically.
Coke, Pepsi, Kellogg's, General Mills all of them are running, not walking, into the organic food business.
For me, when a Wal-Mart enters the organic space, I'm thrilled. It's absolutely one of the most exciting things.
I have dreamed of the day when I could sit with corporate titans and have conversations about organics and sustainability.
-This is Amanda. This is Rand. - Hi Amanda. I'm Rand.
-Rand, nice to meet you. -Tony.
-Tony. Great. - Nice to meet you.
Okay, help me figure out where?
-We both work for Wal-Mart. -You're with Wal-Mart.
Do you know that we don't go to Wal-Mart?
-We've never been. -Yeah.
-Isn't that amazing? - So we had to come to you.
We've never been.
We just started boycotting a long time ago and we just kept riding on that.
Wal-Mart is terribly sensitive to their reputation.
They've obviously been vilified, probably more than any retailer in our current economy.
Actually, it's a pretty easy decision to try to support things like organic, or whatever it might be, based on what the customer wants.
We see that and react to it.
So if it's clear the customer wants it, it's really easy to get behind it, to push forward and try to make that happen.
When I run into my old environmental friends, many are initially horrified by the kinds of company that I'm keeping these days.
But when I then go on to explain what the impact of one purchase order from Wal-Mart is, in terms of not pounds but tons of pesticide, tons of herbicide, tons of chemical fertilizer, the discussion we get away from the emotion and we get down to the facts.
This is really key, though, what you guys are doing here.
I have no illusions about this.
I don't believe that Wal-Mart has come here because they've suddenly had a moral enlightenment.
It's because of economics.
I can debate with my radical friends all day long, but nobody can challenge the fact that a sale of another million dollars to Wal-Mart helps to save the world.
Back around the turn of the last century, the average farmer could feed six or eight people.
Now the average American farmer can feed 126 people.
These are the most productive humans that have ever lived.
The changes down on the farm have been momentous and radical but invisible to most of us, because who knows a farmer anymore?
But their way of life has been revolutionized.
10,000 years ago, farmers started saving their best seeds and planted again in the following year.
That's how seeds have been developed.
That's how corn was developed from a useless grass for the most part to the extremely productive plant it is today.
The idea that any corporation could own a food crop is a very new idea. It wasn't until the 1980s that the Supreme Court said you could patent life.
And that opened the floodgates efforts to patent the most valuable parts of life, which is to say the crops on which we depend.
Monsanto is a chemical company.
They produced DDT, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and then they developed a product called "Roundup."
We started hearing rumblings about genetically-engineered soybeans that could resist the application of Roundup.
When the Roundup was sprayed over top of it, it killed every weed out there except for this Roundup Ready soybean.
I can remember when the first prohibition against seed saving came into being.
Most farmers were just absolutely disgusted with the whole concept.
It's been interesting over the course of 11 years to watch us go from utter contempt for the notion that we can't save our own seed to acceptance.
What happens if a farmer saves the seeds?
Well, you know, really there's only one company involved in this now and that's Monsanto.
They've got a team of private investigators that kind of roam the country and they've got a little 1-800 hotline they take calls on. If they get a call and somebody alleges that somebody saved seed, they'll send an investigator out to look into the matter.
If you save your own seed, you're gonna get a call from somebody from Monsanto.
Two men drove in my driveway at 7:00, 7:30 at night, presented a black card to me and they never told me that they were from Monsanto.
They said that they had had a surveillance team, caught me cleaning beans.
I found it necessary to get up at 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning before the investigators are on the road following me.
I'm gonna say maybe ex-military or ex-police.
They were large and they were intimidating.
I don't know whether they had their surveillance team or whether it was my neighbor that turned me in. I don't know.
Now as I turned to walk in the house, one of them said I could hear in the back-- "He's guilty."
It's a real ingenious device designed back in the 1800s, and Monsanto's gonna close all of them out.
So how many seed cleaners are out there in the country do you think?
In the state of Indiana, there may be six.
Maybe. I'm not aware of how many there used to be?
Have they all been put out of business?
There's nobody left.
When Monsanto soybeans first came on the market, I just never really switched over.
I was getting pretty good yield with the conventional soybeans I'd been using, so I thought "Well, I'll just stay where I'm at."
My neighbors all around me are all GMOs.
If the pollen goes in, if the seed moves in, I am still held accountable.
When you genetically modify a crop, you own it.
We've never had this in agriculture.
Used to be that your land-grant universities, they developed what was called public seed.
The vast majority of the plant breeding was actually done in these public institutions.
Monsanto is very much like Microsoft.
The same way Microsoft owns the intellectual property behind most computers in America, they set out to own the intellectual property behind most of the food in America.
Public plant breeding is a thing of the past.
There virtually are no public seeds anymore.
There's only like four or five varieties that I can actually plant.
Now I have some of the last soybeans coming out of the state of Illinois.
That are not GMO. -Public variety.
When it comes to the point that I can't buy any more certified seed, what do I do? What are my options?
I acquired this list that was mailed to me.
The black list here is Monsanto's unauthorized growers list.
Wow.
Either farmers that have judgments against them, or businesses, or it's farmers that have not submitted their paperwork, will not turn over their records.
For my case, that's why I'm on there because I would not turn over my records.
- Am I on this list? -Yes.
Wow.
I see two of the farmers that I work for on here.
This list now it comes down to the point where I cannot buy Monsanto products.
Right.
So it's coming down to "What can I plant?"
Monsanto is suing me on the basis that I'm encouraging the farmer to break the patent law by cleaning their own seed.
I haven't been in a courtroom yet and my bill is already $25,000.
People that were friends of mine now are reticent to even talk with me.
We've been friends for 50 years, and now we can hardly be seen together.
Right.
I don't think I'm really guilty, but it was cheaper to pay the fine than it was to try to fight it.
Because if you think you're right at something, but yet you admit you're wrong.
Monsanto falsely accused us of violating their patent and breach of contract.
None of it was true.
You go into a market, you find a dominant farmer and if you can ruin them, you scare the rest of them to following the line.
My family spent $400,000 fighting the battle, pretrial.
And we were told it would take another million to take the thing to trial.
We settled out of court.
The way the system appeared to work to me was Lady Justice had the scales and you piled cash on the scales and the one that piled the most cash on the scales, hired the most experts and was most willing to tell the biggest lies, that was the winner.
That seems to be how our justice system functions.
It's terrible. It's terrible.
How can a farmer defend himself against a multinational corporation like Monsanto?
I talked to a young man just three days ago.
They'd been to his farm.
And this poor kid, he's just starting out.
I tried to give them the best advice I could.
Unfortunately the best advice I could give them was try to get out of this thing with your skin intact.
Don't fight them. You've got to roll over and give them what they want, because you can't defend yourself.
In the case of Monsanto, their control is so dominant.
If you want to be in production agriculture, you're gonna be in bed with Monsanto.
They own the soybean.
They are going to control that product from seed to the supermarket.
They are, in effect, gaining control of food.
There has been this revolving door between Monsanto's corporate offices and the various regulatory and judicial bodies that have made the key decisions.
Justice Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto attorney.
That wouldn't be such a big deal if it weren't for one court case that really decided this whole seed-saving issue.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in a case that allowed these companies to prevent farmers from saving their own seed.
Monsanto had very close ties to the Bush administration and the Clinton administration.
This goes to why we haven't had much political debate over this radical change to our food system.
For the last 25 years, our government has been dominated by the industries that it was meant to be regulating.
The challenge is as soon as you have people with expertise in industry, they may turn out to be very good regulators.
It's really about what interests they decide to represent.
You're talking about power centralized power and that power is being used against the people who are really producing the food like the farmers.
It's being used against the workers who work for these companies and it's being used against consumers who are deliberately being kept in the dark about what they're eating, where it comes from and what it's doing to their bodies.
Good afternoon, Madame Chair and members.
SB-63 is a consumer right-to-know measure.
It simply requires that all foods that are cloned must be labeled as cloned foods.
These cloned animals are a fundamentally new thing.
But I find it incredible that the FDA not only wants to allow the sale of meat from cloned animals without further research, but also wants to allow the sale of this meat without any labeling.
How many witnesses in opposition?
Noelle Cremers with California Farm Bureau.
And if I can point out the reason that we are concerned with labeling is it creates unnecessary fear in a consumer's mind.
Until the industry has an opportunity to educate why we want to use this technology and the value of the technology, we don't feel that consumers just having a warning label will help them.
These companies fight tooth and nail against labeling.
The fast food industry fought against giving you the calorie information.
They fought against telling you if there's trans fat in their food.
The meat packing industry for years prevented country-of-origin labeling.
They fought not to label genetically modified foods, and now 78% of the processed food in the supermarket has some genetically- modified ingredient.
I think it's one of the most important battles for consumers to fight is the right to know what's in their food and how it was grown.
Not only do they not want you to know what's in it, they have managed to make it against the law to criticize their products.
Can you tell me how you've changed how you eat?
Yeah, you'll probably have to talk to an attorney before you would put this in there.
What? You can say this is we've stopped.
I know, but I could have the meat and poultry industry coming after me and I really.
It depends on the context.
You're not saying "Someone else don't eat it."
Yeah, I'm sorry, Robbie, but I get asked this all the time.
Initially, my reaction was I don't care. Let them sue me.
Let them try and sue the mother of a dead child and see.
It's pretty amazing that you can't say how you and your family have changed -The veggie libel laws.
The food industry has different protections than other industries do.
We have a lot of questions about this mad cow disease.
If you recall the case where Oprah was sued by the meat industry for something she said on her show.
It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger.
-Good morning, Oprah. - Good morning.
Are you glad to see it's finally winding down?
Well, I think I can say that, right?
I can say that, yeah. I can see the end in sight.
In Colorado it's a felony if you're convicted under a veggie libel law.
So you could go to prison for criticizing the ground beef that's being produced in the state of Colorado.
There is an effort in several farm states to make it illegal to publish a photo of any industrial food operation, any feedlot operation.
At the same time, they've also gotten bills passed that are called cheeseburger bills that make it very very difficult for you to sue them.
These companies have legions of attorneys and they may sue even though they know they can't win just to send a message.
We are on record for the deposition of Maurice Parr in the matter of Monsanto Company and Monsanto Technology versus Maurice Parr.
Mr. Parr, we subpoenaed your bank records in this case. Do you know that?
I'll tell you, what really scared me the most today was the fact that they have every check that I have written from every bank account that I've used in the last 10 years.
Do you own any land, Mr. Parr?
- Yes. -How many acres do you own?
How long have you had this Dell computer?
Which ones are soybean seed cleaning customers?
-Mr. Kaufman? - Beans only.
These people are not just customers, they're personal friends.
It's extremely heart-wrenching for me to know that this list is in the possession of Monsanto.
Harold Sinn?
Beans only.
This is the first case in which a seed company is suing the person who does the cleaning of the seed.
So if Monsanto's claims are upheld in this case, that would not only put Moe out of business, but it would prohibit every grower in the country from doing what Moe does as a precedent in future cases.
Have any of these customers specifically told you that they are not going to use your seed-cleaning services anymore? - Ron Merrill.
This essentially puts me out of business.
We've had a food system that's been dedicated to the single virtue of efficiency, so we grow a very small number of crops, a very small number of varieties, a very small number of companies.
And even though you achieve efficiencies, the system gets more and more precarious.
You will have a breakdown eventually.
And where the breakdown comes in the system we don't always know.
Modern production agriculture is highly dependent on large amounts of petroleum.
Our farm, we're going to use about 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year.
We eat a lot of oil without knowing it.
To bring a steer to slaughter, it's 75 gallons of oil.
So what we're seeing is that this highly-efficient machine does not have the resilience to deal with shocks such as the spike in oil prices.
Food prices last month were 3.9% higher than they were a year ago.
Take corn, another basic source of food, up to a 12-year high.
For a while, we could sell grains so cheaply anywhere in the world, farmers in other countries who aren't being subsidized could not compete with us.
So their capacity to grow food for themselves was compromised.
The world's running out of food and nobody's talking about it. We have no reserves.
There have been protests around the world.
The food crisis has already brought down one government.
A month doesn't go by where there isn't a story in the news that peels back the curtain on how that industrial food is made.
Downer cows too ill or lame to walk being brutalized to get them to their feet for slaughter.
Millions of gallons of concentrated hog manure flushing their contents downriver.
Government's food czar reported that there are no tools in place to track the origin of the latest salmonella outbreak.
Every time one of these stories comes out, America learns a little bit more what's going on in the kitchen where their food is being prepared.
And every time they turn away in revulsion and start looking for alternatives.
The irony is that the average consumer does not feel very powerful.
They think they are the recipients of whatever industry has put out there for them to consume.
Trust me, it's the exact opposite.
When we run an item past the supermarket scanner, we're voting for local or not, organic or not.
At Wal-Mart, we made a decision about a year ago to go through a process of becoming rBST-free in our milk supply.
We made that decision based on customer preference.
Individual consumers changed the biggest company on earth and in so doing, probably put the last nail in the coffin for synthetic growth hormone.
To eat well in this country costs more than to eat badly. It will take more money and some people simply don't have it.
And that's one of the reasons that we need changes at the policy level, so that the carrots are a better deal than the chips.
People think "These companies are so big and so powerful, how are we ever going to change things?"
But look at the tobacco industry.
It had huge control over public policy and that control was broken?
The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry's irresponsible behavior can be changed.
Imagine what it would be if, as a national policy, we said we would be only successful if we had fewer people going to the hospital next year than last year.
How about that for success?
The idea then would be to have such nutritionally dense unadulterated food that people who ate it actually felt better, had more energy, and weren't sick as much.
Now see, that's a noble goal.
I can't change the fact that Kevin's dead.
When you tell somebody you've lost a child, I really don't like that look of pity that comes into their eyes, that they feel sorry for me.
I can have a pity party all by myself very well, thank you. I don't need it from other people.
What I need them to do is listen and help me effect a change.
You have to understand that we farmers, we're gonna deliver to the marketplace what the marketplace demands.
If you want to buy $2 milk, you're gonna get a feedlot in the backyard. It's that simple.
People have got to start demanding good, wholesome food of us.
And we'll deliver. I promise you.
We're very ingenious people. We'll deliver.
That's all I had to say.
